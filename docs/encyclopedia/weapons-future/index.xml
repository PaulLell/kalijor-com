The 10mm caseless round is the standard amunition for most weapons in the Sol system, including law enforcement and military personnel. The auto-pistol favored by most spec-ops personnel has a standard 15 round magazine and selective firing modes of safe, semi-automatic (one round per trigger pull), burst (three rounds per trigger pull), and full automatic (fires for as long as the trigger is held down).</description>

Flash-bangs are a particular type of grenade that are used by law enforcement for the specific purpose of crowd control in enclosed areas. A flash-bang, when triggered, will release an extremely loud, deafening noise, along with a blinding pulse of light. Together these two effects will stun and disorient the people near the point of the detonation.</description>

nav: Grenade percent: 100 authors:
Grenades come in a myriad of forms and functions, from simple explosives to fragmentation grenades, to much more advanced concussion, soni,c and even chemical grenades, if non-lethal options are preferred.
The basic technology is easy for even the untrained to operate, simply pull the pin/press the button and throw the device toward the target. Most operate on extremely reliable solid-state electronic timers and on some of the higher end devices the timer can be adjusted to any length of time required by the user, or even set to detonate on impact.</description>

nav: High-Frequency_Blade percent: 100 authors:
High frequency blades are a new twist on an old standard. They are basically swords and knives made of high strength alloys. Well balanced weapons with keen cutting edges that are then enhanced by the addition of a high-frequency reciprocating motor that causes the blade to vibrate almost beyond the range of human perception. The end result is a bladed weapon that cuts much like a chain saw.</description>

Light Amplification through the Stimulated Emission of Radiation. Lasers have been around for a long, long time, and over the years they have been continually refined, adjusted, and tweaked until they finally became more than simple communications and entertainment tools.
Since the days of the first laser satellite defense systems the technology has advanced with increasing speed.</description>

nav: Monomolecular_Blade percent: 100 authors:
The monomolecular sword or knife is an extremely expensive, and dangerous alternative to the standard swords and knives that have been around for centuries.
The basic idea is still the same however. To make a melee weapon that is as sharp as you can possibly make it and will, in the hands of the correct wielder, be an extremely effective weapon.</description>

nav: Particle_Beam percent: 100 authors:
Particle beams are weapons that accelerate atomic or sub-atomic particles to within a few percent of the speed of light and then direct them at a target through a series of electrostatic (not electromagnetic) focusing/acceleration arrays. Essentially they are very similar to rail guns or electromagnetic mass drivers except that they use electrostatic forces rather than electromagnetic, and they are firing beams of particles rather than solid slugs or projectiles.</description>

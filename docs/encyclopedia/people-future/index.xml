      <description>Gene-line Humans are individuals who have either undergone extensive genetic alteration, or are the offspring of extensively altered individuals. The extent of genetic engineering is almost unlimited and nearly anything is possible, from simply altering the color of a person’s eyes or hair, all the way to rebuilding their body from the ground up to be anything that is desired, from an elf to a minotaur,‘aliens’ and more.
Gene-line humans are by far the most serious threat to anyone trying to establish an understanding of the people they are dealing with.</description>

      <description>(Noo-e-ree Kat-nee-oh) A Nuiri-Qatnio is the extremely rare occurrence of a child of a Psi-line and a Gene-line character, that inherits the majority of the genetic traits/abilities/features from BOTH of their parents. Most Nuiri-Qatnios die within 1D4 years of being born due to the extreme nature of the forces at work within their bodies. Those that do survive, usually have a difficult life ahead of them. Nuiri-Qatnios are feared by most people for their abilities and appearance, and to make matters worse, they are often afflicted with some form of mental problems.</description>

      <description>Psi-Line Humans are those that have undergone extensive modification through genetic engineering or are the children of thusly-engineered individuals. The end result of the genetic engineering is that the Psi-line humans have developed psionic powers to some extent. The range of their powers varies greatly from one individual to the next, but none of them has anything less than minor psionic aptitude.
The genetic modifications these individuals or their parents have undergone have almost all centered around the mind and other neurological systems of the body.</description>

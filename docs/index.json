	"content": "\u0026nbsp; \u0026ldquo;There she is! Get her!\u0026rdquo; the leader of the private army belonging to one Edward Bernstein shouted.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp; \u0026nbsp; He pointed between the two massive air handlers on the roof of the building with the index finger of his left hand, the little submachine gun in his right held at an oblique angle to the floor. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t pointed at her, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be on account of the ten other armed fighters charging past him in the direction he was pointing.\u0026nbsp;\nThe issue with all of the shouting and pointing was that Ocelot\u0026rsquo;s retreat down the narrow gap between those same air handlers was still very much under way. When the weapons started to chatter, their tiny but surprisingly lethal projectiles boring holes into the metal of the roof\u0026rsquo;s machinery, she only just managed to slip around the corner and out of their line of fire. Fragments of bullets and torn-up sheet metal showered the area for a moment before the guns went silent again, replaced by the sounds of tromping boots and whispered directions.\u0026nbsp;\nLeaping forward, she twisted around to fire a couple of covering rounds back toward her pursuers, while she charged another ten feet to the increased safety of the small, concrete and metal structure a few paces from the air handler she had paused behind. Another round of chatter from their little submachine guns followed her, tearing out chunks of concrete and sending pea gravel from the roof in every direction as she spun around the corner, grabbing a protruding cable riser to change the direction of her full-speed dash and launch herself into the wall. The gunfire ceased the moment she was behind cover.\u0026nbsp;\nFor the first time in a long time, she physically checked herself for evidence of bullet wounds. Most rounds would leave no doubt about their impact, but these guys were using top-of-the-line equipment and sub-sonic rounds that had some kind of armor-piercing enchantments on them. Something like that could pass through a person\u0026rsquo;s body so cleanly that it would feel like a splinter or like they\u0026rsquo;d caught their shoulder on something while running around a corner. Under those circumstances, they might keep running, fighting, and exerting themselves\u0026mdash;keeping their heart pumping at maximum. Then the next thing they\u0026rsquo;d know, they\u0026rsquo;d be bleeding to death from a through-and-through that clipped an artery.\nTheses guys were professionals, there was no doubt. Ocelot could tell they had trained and worked together for a long time. Probably years, if not decades, as a unified fighting force, working under life-and-death circumstances in every godforsaken shithole in the world. They knew one another in the way only people who trusted their lives to someone else in the most dire of situations could. They would act as one unit. One organism with but a single goal in mind: the elimination of the foreign body.\u0026nbsp;\nThe problem was, they were a professional hit squad, not a professional protection detail. Their movements, their attacks, their communications, even their presence on the roof at all were indicative of the fact that they were killers. Defenders would never have left their client behind to go chase down a threat. Defenders would have formed a protective wall of muscle, armor, and return fire to keep their client alive. Killers, on the other hand, knew only how to cover their advance and mow down what got in their way.\nOcelot counted the footsteps moving toward her, picturing the locations of the bodies the boots were attached to in her mind\u0026rsquo;s eye and plotting courses in her brain while her hands moved of their own accord to follow the results of the calculations. Her back was pressed up against the side of what she suspected was an elevator equipment room on the roof, preventing anyone from sneaking up behind her, while she focused her entire attention on calculating and listening. The sounds of her opponents were mild by any standard. They would have gone unnoticed by most people in the world. But she had more time in the field hiding from people and sneaking into places she wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be than most world-class thieves. She\u0026rsquo;d turned breaking and entering into a sublime art form and killing her opponents into a ballet that would have put the Bolshoi to shame.\nHer handgun barked, a dozen boots stopped moving, and one pair left the ground, their owner diving for cover behind a large exhaust fan housing and sliding to a halt in the gravelly media covering the roof. A tiny, five-point-seven millimeter hole in the center of his vest trailed a bit of smoke, and the dented metal plate inside pressed harshly against his sternum. Taking a half-step to the side, Ocelot shifted her aim to the left and squeezed off another round, sending a second mercenary to the ground, scrambling for cover with a dented chest plate. As she moved, her left hand spun the blade of her sword through a short arc, shifting it into an earthward grip with the weapon\u0026rsquo;s pommel pointed upward, then drove the rounded, blunt end forward as she turned the corner. The pommel slammed into the gut of the mercenary who had been sneaking around the elevator structure, trying to get behind her, catching him just under the lower edge of the metal plate in his armor and forcing the air from his lungs in a great heave.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; she frowned at the man as he dropped to his knees in front of her, hands wrapping around his abdomen in shock. He looked up at her and for a brief moment, their eyes met through the yellow lenses of his shooting glasses. Then she hooked the blade of her sword around behind his neck, trapping him between the hilt and her forearm and yanked him forward, raising her knee as she did so and driving it into his advancing face with the force of a jackhammer.\u0026nbsp;\nThe man sagged out of her grip, blood pouring from his nose, but his eyes were still safe and intact beneath the safety glasses and his breathing strong, if unsteady from the impact. Letting him drop, she pointed her pistol toward her next target and loosed a third round, sending one more soldier scrambling for cover in surprise.\n\u0026ldquo;You know, it would be kinder to them to just kill them, right?\u0026rdquo; she thought, putting as much vehemence as she could into the unspoken words.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t understand how you could even begin to think such a thing,\u0026rdquo; Bennu\u0026rsquo;s voice replied, filling her head with its lilting tenor. \u0026ldquo;They will live. Which means they will have opportunities and not have their lives cut short.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Clearly you do not understand how this business works,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot thought back, rolling behind an arch of ductwork to avoid a spray of gunfire.\n\u0026ldquo;What is it, exactly, that I am not understanding, then?\u0026rdquo; Bennu responded.\n\u0026ldquo;When I kill their boss, they will have failed\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; Ocelot thought as she scampered from cover to cover, firing a couple more shots as she ran. Most of her shots drilled into the heavy armored plate on the targets\u0026rsquo; chests or backs, forcing them to take cover from her and allowing her to advance toward her objective in relative peace. The rest were intended to break apart some bit of the scene and send fragments and shards at the mercenaries, peppering them with smaller, slower-speed projectiles that wouldn\u0026rsquo;t kill them, but would make their lives less comfortable for a while. \u0026ldquo;\u0026mdash;The news of which will precede them for the rest of their lives and make getting work difficult or impossible,\u0026rdquo; she continued.\n\u0026ldquo;What does that\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; Bennu\u0026rsquo;s disembodied voice began, but Ocelot\u0026rsquo;s thoughts cut her off as they continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Before long, they\u0026rsquo;ll be destitute, desperate, and dispassionate. They\u0026rsquo;ll take whatever work they can get, and it will lead them into a situation where they will be either betrayed by one of their own and killed, or just outright slaughtered in some backwater nowhere, never to be seen or heard from again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you\u0026rsquo;d let me kill or maim at least one of them, they might have a chance of a comeback down the road. It\u0026rsquo;ll send the message that they tried and suffered a loss for their client. But if they all make it out alive, it\u0026rsquo;ll follow them around like an albatross for the rest of their days.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;As I recall,\u0026rdquo; Bennu retorted, \u0026ldquo;the albatross was a good-luck charm until some damn fool killed it and strung it up on their bow.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Makes no nevermind to me.\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shrugged, squeezing the trigger again and twisting around behind the last structure on her side of the building. Her eyes narrowed at the open expanse of air in front of her. Filled with nothing but the dusky skyline of Indianapolis and the Oiler\u0026rsquo;s stadium a few blocks away. \u0026ldquo;I get paid either way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m still not comfortable with the idea of killing even one person, Ocelot. These others deserve a chance at lives of their own. We haven\u0026rsquo;t the right to take it from them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This one person is a killer of thousands, Bennu,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot thought. \u0026ldquo;We talked about this. His operation here is poisoning the area with lead-arsenic waste which is causing birth defects and untimely deaths.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know. And that is the only reason I agreed to help you with this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And I am forever grateful. Are you ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m ready,\u0026rdquo; the mage confirmed.\nThe crunching of gravel under combat boots approached Ocelot\u0026rsquo;s position as she paused to think at her friend. With calm, steady hands, she ejected the magazine from her pistol, returning it to one of the many magical portals scattered around her person and removed another, one with a yellow stripe on it, and slid it home into the weapon, thumbing the side release to chamber the first round from the new magazine. \u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she thought, jamming the tip of her sword into the side of the structure. Its blade came to life with a faint blue glow and it moved through the metal of the duct work like a hot knife through butter, carving an Ocelot-sized hole in a matter of seconds.\n\u0026ldquo;Those guys are almost on you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot responded, sheathing her sword and peeling the metal flap open with her free hand. \u0026ldquo;Is he there?\u0026rdquo;\nBennu\u0026rsquo;s response was hesitant, as if she considered not giving it before her thought came back in halting fashion. \u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Here we go,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot replied, lurching forward into the dark hole she\u0026rsquo;d torn open in the roof.\nDarkness surrounded her as she fell down the shaft, her hands and feet pressing against the inside walls to create drag and slow her descent. The drumming sound of metal being bumped against followed her in the darkness, but she expected that to be the case. It was just sheetmetal after all. Her eyes narrowed in the darkness, watching darker splotches go by as she descended, counting them off in her head until she was coming up on the fifth one.\n\u0026ldquo;Five,\u0026rdquo; she thought, a grin spreading across her face as she switched her feet to\u0026nbsp; the narrow width of the duct and her left boot immediately caught on a side duct, arresting her fall. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m telling you, it\u0026rsquo;s like child\u0026rsquo;s play,\u0026rdquo; she thought. Working to crouch down in the awkward space and move into the horizontal shaft, an almost casual conversation from above her drew her attention for a moment as she dangled in the shaft.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;Good thing I brought my grenades this time,\u0026rdquo; one of the voices announced with a tone of defiance.\n\u0026ldquo;I am never going to hear the end of that, am I?\u0026rdquo; another sighed, just before her ears shifted to the sound of several objects rattling down the duct above her. She glanced upward in time to see half a dozen small objects rattling down the duct above her, silhouetted by the light form the roof above.\n\u0026ldquo;Grenades,\u0026rdquo; she groaned, hastening her movements to exit the death trap. Lunging into the smaller horizontal passage just as the tumbling explosives dropped past, she pulled her legs up tight to her chest, pressed her hands into her ears, and closed her eyes, preparing for the concussive blast that was about to abuse her body. A second later, there were several loud popping sounds, followed by what sounded like a hail storm. Several small bits of hard rubber peppered her naked legs, causing her to grunt, then frown at the realization that she\u0026rsquo;d been fooled by a half dozen riot grenades. Uncurling herself, she pressed forward, low-crawling her way to the third vent with a sour expression on her face.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you say grenades?\u0026rdquo; Bennu\u0026rsquo;s mind called out with a tone of panic.\n\u0026ldquo;False alarm,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shook her head. \u0026ldquo;They were just party favors. Nearly there now.\u0026rdquo; Punching the next vent out of the floor of her raceway, she followed it out of the hole like a snake, unfurling herself on the other side in a great, rolling wave, hands still gripping the edge of the vent as her feet swung downward, pendulum like. She caught the door guard in the bridge of the nose, dropping his form to the ground in a single hit. She dropped herself to the ground, nearly silent in the wake of the rattling grate and the slumping body.\nReaching for the knob of the door the man had been standing next to, she twisted it as she thought, \u0026ldquo;I love it when a plan comes to\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; Stopping, she eyed the knob and raised a platinum eyebrow at the fact that it had stopped without opening the door.\n\u0026ldquo;What was that?\u0026rdquo; Bennu asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Standby one,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot replied, trying the knob again. It rattled but wouldn\u0026rsquo;t turn past the tiny fraction of an arc it had moved previously. Locked. Growling, Ocelot stooped to the unconscious guard and rifled his pockets. In a second the floor was littered with the man\u0026rsquo;s sidearm, several spare magazines, a backup pistol, a flashlight, his wallet and car keys, and one frustrated feline assassin, eyeing the offending doorknob through narrowed eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything okay?\u0026rdquo; Bennu\u0026rsquo;s mind called out to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Door\u0026rsquo;s locked,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot sighed back.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, what?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The door,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot responded curtly, \u0026ldquo;is locked.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you just say the door is locked?\u0026rdquo; A trickle of mirth was unmistakable in Bennu\u0026rsquo;s tone.\n\u0026ldquo;They weren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to lock the door when they left,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot growled more.\n\u0026ldquo;Because heaven forbid they protect their boss like they\u0026rsquo;re supposed to!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not helping,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot frowned, trying to bash the door open with her shoulder. It rattled a little under her slight weight but remained stubbornly locked and solid.\n\u0026ldquo;I can see the headlines now,\u0026rdquo; Bennu giggled. \u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo;World-class assassin defeats ten armed soldiers only to be stopped by a locked door.\u0026rsquo;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It hasn\u0026rsquo;t stopped me.\u0026rdquo; Ocelot cast her eyes around for anything that might be of use. There was a fire extinguisher nearby, but that was about it. Sighing, she slid her sword out of its sheath on her back once more and shook her head as she drew her pistol in the other hand. \u0026ldquo;Just be ready.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I\u0026rsquo;m ready, just as soon as you get past your implacable foe, the door,\u0026rdquo; Bennu giggled back.\nWith a grunt of frustration, Ocelot sliced her sword downward, making a clean cut through the metal door jamb and separating the door\u0026rsquo;s bolt from the rest of the mechanism. One swift kick later and it was swinging wide on its hinges, the assassin stalking through in a cloud of frustrated anger.\nA tall, girthy figure within was clearly surprised by her entrance, despite the rattling she\u0026rsquo;d given the door. He had a phone pressed to his ear and his pants around his ankles as his dirty, brownish eyes met hers. Three half-naked women and two similarly undressed men could be seen around him, running and diving for whatever cover they could find in a hurry. It was a scene right out of any college frat film, except for the part where the man on the phone saw Ocelot, gun pointed right at him and an ear-to-ear grin spread across her face as she broke into a sprint right at him.\nTheir eyes locked for a moment as she thought, \u0026ldquo;Here I come,\u0026rdquo; and squeezed the trigger.\nThe window behind the man spiderwebbed as the enchanted, armor-piercing round drilled through his skull, leaving a perfectly round hole in its wake, and continued on through the pane. The man dropped the phone and it began to accelerate toward the floor, much like Ocelot toward the window, as the man stared at her dumbly, not yet realizing he\u0026rsquo;d just been killed.\nBy the time his lifeless body slumped to the floor, Ocelot was already through the shattered window, holstering her pistol and latching it in place as she twisted her body into a somersault thirty stories above the ground. \u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; she thought.\n\u0026ldquo;Incoming,\u0026rdquo; Bennu returned.\nOcelot closed her eyes, reveling in the brief free fall and folding her arms across her chest. Her ankles locked together, and she tried to relax her muscles as she prepared for the mage to do her work.\n\u0026ldquo;Now,\u0026rdquo; Bennu said.\nA blinding flash of light pressed through Ocelot\u0026rsquo;s closed eyelids and she felt the world close in and grow cold around her. Every muscle in her body clenched, despite her best efforts. She felt as if she were being pulled, feet first, through a drinking straw.\nAn instant later, the world returned to her senses and she felt the comforting embrace of the deceleration airbag they had set up in the Oiler\u0026rsquo;s stadium on the opposite end of the field from where the annual gaming convention had set up its operation for the weekend. Air escaped the structure beneath her, bleeding energy away from her fall until she felt the slight thump of her body hitting the ground beneath it. Not taking even an instant to thank the stars for her survival, she rolled out of the airbag and smiled at her dark-skinned companion, who stood there, arms crossed over her chest and foot tapping in expectant, silent anger.\n\u0026ldquo;Nice shot!\u0026rdquo; Ocelot beamed. \u0026ldquo;You feel like dancing? I hear there\u0026rsquo;s some kind of gaming convention in town and they have a ball tonight. Could be lots of people in crazy costumes getting their freak on. Want to check it out before our flight back to Denver?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You are impossible,\u0026rdquo; Bennu growled. \u0026ldquo;And you have made me complicit in a murder.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You agreed to help me,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shrugged, rolling her yellow eyes. \u0026ldquo;I wasn\u0026rsquo;t exactly begging you to tag along.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You said you were going to swan dive off a forty-story building into a glass of water if I didn\u0026rsquo;t help,\u0026rdquo; Bennu challenged, throwing her arms up in the air.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;And you believed me?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot raised an accusing eyebrow at her companion.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course not,\u0026rdquo; Bennu protested waving her arms in frustration. \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;d have done something just as stupid if I hadn\u0026rsquo;t helped.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You know, I was at this a long while before you came along,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot challenged, raising a finger to her companion as the pair of them began moving toward the exit from the field where their car was waiting for them. \u0026ldquo;Always managed to make it work in the past.\u0026rdquo;\nBennu glared at the assassin for a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t some Spy vs. Spy cartoon, Ocelot. People don\u0026rsquo;t dive off buildings without backup plans and live to brag about it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Good thing I\u0026rsquo;m not people then, right? I\u0026rsquo;m the incomparable Ocelot!\u0026rdquo; She struck a haughty pose, holding it for a moment as if there were a thousand paparazzi shooting pictures of her to put on the covers of every magazine that meant anything to anyone.\n\u0026ldquo;You mean the incompetent Ocelot,\u0026rdquo; Bennu snarked, turning a feral grin on her companion. \u0026ldquo;The keyless killer,\u0026rdquo; she carried on, taking shots at her friend as she started marching toward the street again.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not fair,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot groused, trotting to catch up to her companion. \u0026ldquo;They weren\u0026rsquo;t supposed to post a guy there without the key when they left.\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;The uncentering Ocelot,\u0026rdquo; Bennu continued, a wide grin plastered across her face, chest swelling with pride at her jabs.\n\u0026ldquo;I know where you sleep,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot grumbled.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe, but I keep my doors locked,\u0026rdquo; Bennu cackled.\nClearly done with the gag, Ocelot pointed across the street toward one of the larger hotels connected to the convention center and asked, \u0026ldquo;So, straight back to Denver? Or do we take that left in Albuquerque and swing by the GenCon ball on the way out?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know,\u0026rdquo; Bennu replied as they stood on the sidewalk next to one another. If it\u0026rsquo;s already started and they\u0026rsquo;ve locked the doors, we may not be able to get in.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Assassin, remember?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot snarled at her friend, indicating herself with a wave of her hand.\u0026nbsp;\nRolling her eyes, Bennu sighed and motioned toward the dance. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s go check it out. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been to a dance before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 2\n"

	"content": "-Prelude-\nOcelot skated through the encroaching darkness, a ghost in the failing light of the evening.\nThe sounds of shouting and gunfire echoed around her like a symphony, titillating her senses and bringing a smile to her lips. She streaked over rooftops and bounded off of parked cars, turning flips in the air and always hitting the ground running, leaving everyone else wanting for a target to train their weapons upon. The long front tendrils of stark white hair at her temples, a stark contrast to the short, wedge style of the back, flowed over her shoulders, trailing behind her like the feeding tentacles of a giant squid on the prowl. Her athletic body made easy work of the evening\u0026rsquo;s running, jumping, and dancing.\nAnd it was a dance; no question.\nVaulting off the edge of a garage roof, she twisted around in midair, angling her feet toward the ground and landing between two spooked guards. Their automatic weapons had just started to move as she descended, her arms opened like wings, bearing the pair to the ground with her momentum and using their bodies to break her fall. Pushing herself, and them, into a forward roll to bleed off the rest of her momentum, she came up to a crouch, hands twined up in her targets\u0026rsquo; shirts, binding them to her. A few well-placed kicks and they were unconscious, drooling on the ground.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, boys, but you\u0026rsquo;re not on my list. Maybe we\u0026rsquo;ll get to play another day. You\u0026rsquo;ll have to promise to be really wicked, though. That\u0026rsquo;s the only way to get on the list.\u0026rdquo; Grinning, she patted them each on the shoulder, then tumbled forward, coming up at a dead run with a trail of bullets following her as she went.\n\u0026ldquo;Did you see that?\u0026rdquo; One of the estate\u0026rsquo;s guards asked a companion. \u0026ldquo;She dropped those two like a sack of hammers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; the other replied, narrowing suspicious eyes behind yellowed shooting glasses, \u0026ldquo;but she didn\u0026rsquo;t kill them. I wonder why\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;They aren\u0026rsquo;t on my naughty list,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot responded from her perch on the wall behind them.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell?\u0026rdquo; The first guard shouted, the pair turning toward the sound.\n\u0026ldquo;Luckily for you two, neither are you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she added, detaching her tail and shaking it loose to reveal it as a long, braided whip. \u0026ldquo;Unless you make me pencil you in.\u0026rdquo;\nThe two began to raise their weapons toward her, but she slipped off the wall, dropping like a shadow toward them. The tip of her whip slashed through the air like a blade, wrapping itself around one of their necks and, as she approached them, she planted her feet on the other guard\u0026rsquo;s shoulders and pushed off, while pulling hard on the handle of her whip. The two guards crashed together and then fell uncontrollably apart. Taking advantage of their stunned states, Ocelot kicked one in the chin, yanking on her whip once more to draw his companion closer, then drove her knee into his gut, taking only a second to uncoil her whip from his neck before moving on, as they both slumped, unconscious.\n\u0026ldquo;Man, this Adrian guy needs to hire some better thugs,\u0026rdquo; she mused to herself, returning the re-coiled whip to its resting place at her tailbone, where it once again resembled the tail of some great cat. Checking her watch, she frowned at the countdown timer steadily creeping lower, then shook the screen back into darkness and dashed off again, angling toward the central building of the Malcone estate.\nAdrian Malcone was a paranoid of extreme magnitude. Almost certainly not without plenty of cause, but still. The man had built a fortress around himself and populated it to overflowing with armed toughs, most of whom were obviously overpaid for their services. Still, it was a lot to get through, between the high, razor wire-topped walls, remote gun turrets, wandering guards, and tiered internal wall defenses, he\u0026rsquo;d made it nearly impossible for anyone to get to him. He\u0026rsquo;d even gone so far as to have mages enchant his grounds, walls, buildings, and even vehicles, to prevent teleportation and most other transportation magic. And, in the unlikely event that anyone made it through all of that, he had setup a panic room in the main house. A panic room with a uniquely designed one-way teleport that would allow him to escape to safety through his own wards without being torn to pieces by the magic that prevented people from teleporting back in.\nHe had spent a lot of money to make himself untouchable. Except that he was a consummate gambler. He gambled with everything, from money, to cars, and even houses and sexual partners. If he could bet on, with, for, or about it, he would. Anything was fair game, except his own life and safety. In order to sate his primal need, he had setup a long-standing poker game at which he could satisfy his compulsion whilst keeping a relatively low profile. His paranoia, however, meant that options for a venue were limited, at best. He refused to play in anyone else\u0026rsquo;s home or facilities, but also refused to have potentially traitorous guests in his own home. The only compromise he\u0026rsquo;d been able to arrive at was to host the game on his property, in a small out-building near one of the inner walls, about five hundred yards from the main house.\nIt had cost Ocelot a lot of time and money merely to learn about the game, where and when it was hosted, and the particulars of Adrian\u0026rsquo;s defenses, but the payment for filling his contract was going to be more than enough to make it all worthwhile. Assuming, that is, that she beat him to the panic room.\nShe had quickly discovered that, while he had given in to his baser need to gamble, he had done so in the safest way he could manage. His game room sat atop a secret underground tunnel that led, via several secure, armored doors, directly to the antechamber outside his panic room. If he got into that room without her, then she would miss her mark, be shamed in her industry and, worst of all, wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get paid. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish him in the game room because he had fifteen armed guards in there with him, plus all his fellow players and their people. The place was built like a bank vault, with no windows and only one door at the end of a guarded hallway, and none of those totally fake person-sized air vents that were always depicted in films for heroes to crawl through and infiltrate the bad guy\u0026rsquo;s lair.\nNo, she had to get him alone, and the only place he was ever truly alone was in his panic room, since he would never allow anyone he didn\u0026rsquo;t trust in there with him. Which ruled out all other persons, both alive and dead.\nWell, she mused, he probably went to the bathroom alone as well. But there was no way she was going to kill someone while they were taking a dump. That was just mean.\nShe knew it took him four minutes, thirty-one seconds to get from the game room to the panic room, using the tunnel. He could do it in two, but his own paranoia worked in her favor there. He\u0026rsquo;d had security panels installed at each reinforced door in his escape tunnel and he\u0026rsquo;d have to stop and confirm his identify at each, rather than just run by and close them behind him. Turns out, a person can actually be way too paranoid.\nDue to the added delay, she had just over four minutes to get into his panic room before he did, and she\u0026rsquo;d started the clock just before she\u0026rsquo;d started her ruckus and set the alarms off. Now she had just over two minutes to finish her charge and collect her coin.\nAdjusting her course, she darted toward the main house, where the only other physical entrance to the panic room was located. Her path was winding, with frequent adjustments to carry her around confrontations wherever possible, in light of the time. Of course, even if she\u0026rsquo;d had more time, she preferred to avoid fights wherever possible on general principle. Fights stole time and cost energy, and she had neither to spare at the best of times. Not to mention the cost in ammunition and supplies that cut into her bottom line.\nShe sprinted across the winding path to the main house, enjoying the chance to open up a little. She spent a lot of time running and exercising when she wasn\u0026rsquo;t working. Between that and her other extracurricular activities, she was more fit than most professional athletes, which allowed her to eat up the distance in mere moments. She caught a pair of armed goons just as they were pulling the doors shut and waylaid them with relative ease. Surprised people were always easier prey, and that made life so much better.\nThe interior layout of the house was exactly as her bribe-liberated information indicated, allowing her to easily dart through rooms, around corners, and keep from sight as much as possible. Wherever it was an option, she used staff hallways and stairs, knowing they would be less likely to be used during an emergency and that most of the thugs and important people would avoid them, if they even knew they existed at all.\nDown two floors, through the wine cellar with its hundreds of dusty bottles lining either side of the long, cool corridor, and the door was in sight!\nThe huge metal vault-style door stood open, with two armed guards outside. The pair stood, hands on weapons and radios, ready for trouble and able to call for backup in an instant, should the need arise. Which meant that she needed to deal with them both at the same time, and as quickly, and quietly, as possible. Before they noticed her, she slipped into the shadows between two wine racks, then slid behind them, pressing her back against the wall and side-stepping down the row of racks as stealthily as she could. Her internal countdown continued, as accurate as any watch she\u0026rsquo;d ever owned after of years of timing things in her head, and she knew she had just moments to get through the door before Malcone would arrive and seal himself inside. If he made it and she wasn\u0026rsquo;t already through the door, then her chance would be lost, possibly forever, and worse, she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t get paid for her work.\nDrawing nearer to the pair, she heard them talking quietly to one another, their words passing in careful whispers while they presumably darted their eyes around for trouble.\n\u0026ldquo;How many do you think there are?\u0026rdquo; One of them said.\n\u0026ldquo;Doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound like anyone has a good count. Robins announced a minute ago that he found a remote-operated turret with an AR15 on it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Samuels said something similar as well just a moment ago. Probably a small group then, if they\u0026rsquo;re using remotes to bolster their ranks.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;The only actual sightings I\u0026rsquo;ve heard reported are of a girl in a cheerleader outfit. You don\u0026rsquo;t think maybe\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I don\u0026rsquo;t think one little girl in a cheerleading outfit is in any way capable of successfully breaching our defenses.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Boss is headed this way, though.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And Jurgen did say there was a cheerleader\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For the last time, we are not being assaulted by a cheerleader. The idea is preposterous, at best.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you implying that a cheerleader is incapable of conducting an assault?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, man. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying it isn\u0026rsquo;t likely that toppling empires at gunpoint is going to be in a cheerleader\u0026rsquo;s skill set, you know?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think that qualifies as profiling, man. That\u0026rsquo;s not right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hal, I\u0026rsquo;m not profiling just because I think it is unlikely that a cheerleader is singlehandedly assaulting one of the most heavily defended compounds in the state. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying that it is incredibly unlikely.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Unlikely because she\u0026rsquo;s a cheerleader? Are you saying cheerleaders can\u0026rsquo;t assault citadels?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, man. I\u0026rsquo;m just saying that\u0026hellip; Ugh. You know what? I\u0026rsquo;m not having this conversation with you. We just need to get the boss into the panic room, then we can go find out if it\u0026rsquo;s a stupid cheerleader or not\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right, that\u0026rsquo;s it!\u0026rdquo; Ocelot growled, leaping out of the shadows to stand in front of the pair. Her short, pleated skirt swished around her hips as she moved and her tail slashed at the air behind her. Fixing accusing eyes on the guards, she bared her teeth and added, \u0026ldquo;I am not stupid!\u0026rdquo;\nThey both stood stunned for a heartbeat before one reached for his radio and the other began to raise his compact sub-machine gun. With a nearly feline hiss, Ocelot lashed out with one hand, punching the first of them in the throat hard enough that he started to gasp and wheeze, hands going to his throat to clutch it in shock. With her other hand, she grabbed the barrel of the rising weapon, lifting it up further, and faster, than the man had intended, then smashed it into his forehead several times in rapid succession.\n\u0026ldquo;You really think I look like a cheerleader, though?\u0026rdquo; she asked, spinning around to twirl the hem of her little skirt up and striking a heroic pose. \u0026ldquo;I always admired them.\u0026rdquo;\nThe gun-wielder dropped to his knees, tumbling over backward, while Ocelot turned her attention to the gasping guard. \u0026ldquo;Although, I never was a cheerleader, so I guess I might have overreacted a bit. You really shouldn\u0026rsquo;t disparage people just for their interests, though. I mean, do you have any idea how hard cheerleaders work? Between all the physical stuff and the need to keep their grades up? Most of them are fitter and smarter than a good portion of students.\u0026rdquo;\nThe gasping man gave her a puzzled look as his face turned blue. After a second, his eyes rolled back into his head and he followed his comrade to the floor in a heap.\n\u0026ldquo;Not to say that football players are stupid or anything. I met a couple smart ones,\u0026rdquo; she carried on as she bent down and hooked a hand in the combat webbing each man was wearing, then dragged them through the open metal door of the panic room. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just a bit presumptuous to say they can\u0026rsquo;t do something, just because they\u0026rsquo;re cheerleaders is all.\u0026rdquo;\nMaking sure the area in front of the door was cleared of any signs of the guards and her own passing, she hid them under the bed in the panic room and settled into a good spot to cover the door. As she reached zero in her mental countdown, she heard the sounds of footsteps outside, followed by a terse remark from a man who sounded like he was used to giving orders and having them followed.\n\u0026ldquo;Where are the guards?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Probably outside, sir. It\u0026rsquo;s still pretty crazy out there. Radio chatter is asking for assistance to shut down a half dozen more remote guns and they just found two unconscious men out by the garage.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; the commanding voice responded. \u0026ldquo;As soon as the door\u0026rsquo;s closed, you go help them sweep the property.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, sir!\u0026rdquo; Two voices snapped back in unison.\nOcelot watched a man in his forties step through the door and press a button. It began to close with uncanny speed, given its obvious bulk. He kept looking at it until the panel next to the door announced that it had locked and sealed, causing the lights in the room to come on, then he turned around to take in the room, finally spotting her silhouette in the corner, gun raised in his direction.\n\u0026ldquo;Who the hell\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Malcone,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot nodded at him. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not here to monologue about what a douche you are, or how many lives you\u0026rsquo;ve ruined with your drugs and your gun sales. I\u0026rsquo;ve been paid to kill you and that\u0026rsquo;s just what I\u0026rsquo;m going to do. But first, I have one question.\u0026rdquo;\nHis eyes darted around the room, one hand twitching toward the holster under his jacket, but a subtle shake of her head changed his mind and the hand froze. His emergency teleport was across the room from him, a raised circular dais about two feet from where she stood in the corner, leaning against the wall with flippant casualness. Scanning the room in the bright overhead lights, his eyes came to rest on the still hand of one of his men under the edge of the bed and his breath caught in his throat. Looking back up at her he asked, \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do I look like a cheerleader to you?\u0026rdquo; she asked, raising the barrel of her pistol to his head.\n\u0026nbsp;\nInterlude 1\n"

	"content": "-1-\n\u0026ldquo;Tal Renner,\u0026rdquo; the prim, mechanical voice of the proctor announced.\nTal stood up from the self-adjusting, body-forming memory plastic chair he\u0026rsquo;d been planted in for over an hour and made his way toward the counter where the woman stood, pristine and statuesque in her perfectly-tailored business suit and genetically engineered physique. She was tall and utterly fit. While her beauty would be such that it would have reduced any of their ancestors to a quivering puddle of hormones, it was so blas\u0026eacute; in this day and age to be genetically adjusted that she was, at best, average when compared to the other occupants of the room. Certainly, she was dressed in such a way as to enhance her beauty in subtle and understated ways, not flaunting it so much as suggesting it to the beholder. If anything, she had that attractiveness that can only be seen in a person who was utterly confident, knowing that they held all the cards and had a lifetime of experiences to back their play.\nHe hated her.\nMaybe hate was a harsh word. It certainly felt harsh as it rolled around in his head, eyes fixed on her stern visage. Her bright green eyes were fixed on him as he moved across the waiting room, her powder-pink, almost-bordering-on-grey hair fixed in a tight bun at the back of her head. She looked at him over the rims of a pair of half-framed glasses that completed the stereotypical overbearing librarian look, despite the fact that she was as unlikely to actually need vision correction as anyone else in the Conglomerate. Genetic engineering had long since removed the need for any such appliances, for most people. It was more likely that the spectacles were for aesthetics, or a computer display, relaying information about her job duties, and the world around her.\nInformation such as his test score.\nTal moved up to the desk, his tall, lanky form slouched over slightly, his blonde hair unwashed but too short to look like he\u0026rsquo;d been neglecting it. His blue eyes at last met hers as he came to a stop, hands buried in his pockets to prevent them from wringing nervously in anticipation. The small room had a dozen other young men and women in it, all sitting anxiously, waiting for their turn to receive news as to how their futures were about to change. The stark white space was jarring in its bright cleanliness. The soft, white light abolishing all shadows and the faint smell of mild disinfectant lingering in the air, testament to the regular cleanings the room likely received.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s me,\u0026rdquo; he said to the woman. \u0026ldquo;Tal Renner.\u0026rdquo;\nShe continued to eye him, not so much as twitching the corners of her lips in hint as to her expectation.\nHe stared at her for a moment before realizing what it was she wanted from him.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit, sorry,\u0026rdquo; he said, extracting his right hand from his pocket and waiving the back of it over the vaguely square, illuminated pad on the counter. A beeping sound as sharp as the woman\u0026rsquo;s features sounded out, confirming that the computer had read his identity chip and she nodded as the information scrolled across the inside of her dark-framed spectacles.\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Renner,\u0026rdquo; she began, her voice lilting in a pitch-perfect tone that would have made any career singer jealous. Coming from her though, it felt more like a gunshot to the face. \u0026ldquo;Your results indicate that, while you have a staggeringly high IQ, acuity, and ability to learn, you are not well suited, socially, to our team. Aegis Online thanks you for your interest in working with us and wishes you good luck in your future endeavors.\u0026rdquo;\nGobsmacked, Tal took half a step back from the counter, narrowing his eyes at her. The words she\u0026rsquo;d uttered, while sensical, refused to click into place in his mind. Socially suited? He turned and looked over the room full of waiting people, most of whom quickly looked away as his eyes moved past them, trying not to get caught looking at the poor schlub who\u0026rsquo;d just been smacked down from any chance at a decent standing in life. They were all engineered in some way. All of them. Five-hundred years ago, maybe one in a million people would be born with half of the beauty, brains, and ambition of any one of them, but now, all it took was a few thousand credits and a trip to the local natal lab to insure a child was the paragon of human potential. Just like everyone else. Nowhere did he see anyone with less than the ideal, beautiful appearance of a person who could only get that way through science.\nThen there was him. His parents couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford it, true. Even if they could though, they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have done it. Sure, they had the usual sweep for genetic disease markers done, but that was standard practice. It cost less, after all, to clean up an unborn infant\u0026rsquo;s health problems than it did to deal with them in a developed citizen.\nAlthough, he suspected the truth was even more insipid than the cost of the health care versus the in-utero adjustments. The truth was that it cost the Conglomerate more in lost productivity to have their workers in hospital than it did to cure them of such illnesses before they were born.\nThe real reason his parents hadn\u0026rsquo;t done it though, was because they believed that nature should, to large extent, be given leave to take its own course. A course that was currently leading him away from a decent career with a major corporation. True, it was only an internship, but if he couldn\u0026rsquo;t get in the door for that, even with the rest of his test results going right to the top of the scale, then an actual position there would be out of the question.\n\u0026ldquo;So,\u0026rdquo; he looked back at the woman, pushing his hands as deeply into his pockets as they could go in order to prevent himself from gesturing angrily with them, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not good enough to work at Aegis because I\u0026rsquo;m not as tweaked as these people?\u0026rdquo; He jerked his head over his shoulder toward the rest of the room.\n\u0026ldquo;You have been judged on your individual merits, Mr. Renner,\u0026rdquo; the woman responded cooly. \u0026ldquo;Anything else would be unfair. You just won\u0026rsquo;t fit in here and we feel that interpersonal synergy is of paramount importance to the functionality of our team.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t fit in?\u0026rdquo; he growled. \u0026ldquo;How can you possibly know that based upon a practical skill evaluation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Your mandatory blood sample has yielded a psychological profile that we find to be not in keeping with the general direction in which Aegis Online is currently headed, Mr. Renner. I assure you, it is not personal.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Feels pretty damn personal,\u0026rdquo; he chuffed. \u0026ldquo;Fine, whatever. What about the server room or something in R\u0026amp;D? I love science and math. There have to be places where interpersonal compatibilities aren\u0026rsquo;t an issue, right?\u0026rdquo; He forced a calm that he did not feel into his voice, hoping it would appear as if he could be what they wanted.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Renner,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;It isn\u0026rsquo;t my decision to make, and if I\u0026rsquo;m honest, I could not, in good conscious, recommend you for a position with the company if it was. Please, have a nice day, and thank you for your time.\u0026rdquo; She smiled at him then, a beautiful gesture that turned her already attractive face into an advertisement for, well, anything. But it failed to reach her eyes and made Tal a bit sick to his stomach at its hollowness. Shifting her attention from him, she announced the next applicant\u0026rsquo;s name as if Tal was no longer standing there in front of her. \u0026ldquo;Serah Ibanez.\u0026rdquo;\nTal shrank back from the woman, scanning the room again. Once more, the faces of other curious teens snapped back to their own space, pretending to read from their own computers or play their games. Anything to avoid meeting the eyes of the misanthrope in the room. A young woman stood up and looked at him for a brief moment, her eyes quickly flitting to the woman behind the counter, then back to him, as if trying to plot a course that would end in her acceptance speech and not get her too close to the failure. Shaking his head, Tal took a deep breath and propelled himself toward the door on his long legs, making sure to pass in close proximity to the maximum number of other candidates as he could on the way out of the waiting room.\nThe test hadn\u0026rsquo;t even been difficult.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nThe trip back out of the building was short, Aegis Online made sure to keep any non-corporate people as close to the street as possible, presenting visitors with their own short hallway that led directly to the waiting room and offered no additional access to the facility. The corridor was filled with propaganda about Aegis Online and everything the company was doing to make humanity, and its citizens, better. Images of beautiful people doing amazing things abounded on the wall displays, depicting engineers and scientists building gadgets and operating lab equipment. Men and women in suits, presenting groundbreaking new ideas to rooms full of equally beautiful people, ready to make decisions about the future of humanity. Aegis Online was famous for having interest in almost every aspect of technology, from weapons, to ships, and through computers and small household appliances. They had made their beginnings in the world of online gaming generations ago, but had long since branched out into\u0026nbsp; just about everything else.\nThe models in the images were all smiling happily. Full of exuberance and energy for the many challenges that lay ahead of them. Laughing at him as he moved past them.\nShaking his head, he moved toward the exit, stopping when he reached it to look at the last image in the corridor. There was depicted a man and a woman, wearing bright, shiny combat armor, and sporting the most high-tech weapons he suspected Aegis Online had in their patent portfolio. The pair stood heroically on some alien planet with a group of equally-impressive figures behind them and a large ship floating in the air above them. The image carried with it an air of urgency and adventure, and the caption read simply, \u0026ldquo;Paving the way for the future of humanity.\u0026rdquo;\nThe Colonial Marines had always been where he wanted to be, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t take just anyone. Not for the good jobs, anyway. Which was why he was there, at Aegis Online, applying for an internship. Having history with the company and documented proficiency in relevant tasks would have ensured him a position on special teams. He was already near the top of his class in academics since entering his final year of Conglomerate-mandated education. He headed four social clubs and was in the top ten on the cross-country running team at his school. With graduation mere days away, he was looking at a rather harsh introduction to the world a lot sooner than he was going to be able to comfortably handle it.\nHe knew his parents would never kick him out. They loved him and wanted to make sure he had everything he needed in life. It was he who wanted to move on though. His brother and sister would only benefit from his not being a drain on their relatively meager resources. He loved them all dearly and wanted the best for all of them.\nTal\u0026rsquo;s eyes shifted from the image of the Marines on the display down to his hands. Spreading his three fingers and one thumb out wide, he shook his head. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t really a birth defect, if a doctor was consulted on the matter. Somewhere in his parent\u0026rsquo;s past, one of their relatively close ancestors had undergone genetic modification and bits of it had crept into the germline of their DNA. That meant that the alterations could be passed on to offspring, and even if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t, it still slept in the family\u0026rsquo;s genetic code, waiting for just the right confluence of events to manifest itself. In his case, it had skipped his parents and landed squarely on him.\nFortunately, none of his siblings had expressed any such mutations, so their places in society were much more likely to be desirable ones.\nFor him, however, things were not looking good. None of the major corporations, for which he was eminently qualified to work, would accept him as an employee once they got a look at his DNA. While it wasn\u0026rsquo;t strictly legal to discriminate against a person for such things, it was easy enough to make up other, much more nebulous, unprovable reasons to deny a person an opportunity. Even the corporate military forces wouldn\u0026rsquo;t accept him without a sponsorship from their associated corporations, which he could not get if they would not give him even an unpaid internship.\nThe sad part was that nearly everyone had genetic tweaks. It was all but expected and nearly the sort of thing that would create ridicule in young people who identified a peer that hadn\u0026rsquo;t been adjusted in some way. An IQ boost here, a metabolism tweak there. Everyone was beautiful, smart, and healthy. All over human space, people were expressing themselves through genetic engineering, growing horns, fangs, tails, even functioning wings. But if someone wanted to work for the Conglomerate directly, the company would not accept of anyone with obvious, outward signs of genetic tampering. Of course, you had to be smart, beautiful, and healthy, but you would never openly admit to having got that way through science. It simply wasn\u0026rsquo;t done.\nSighing, he shook his head, jammed his deformed hands back into his pockets and slipped out the automatic door onto the street outside. The light of the sun shone down through the massive dome that covered the city of Tranquility, clouds drifting lazily beneath the transparent armor that kept the atmosphere in place for the city\u0026rsquo;s residents. Shifting his eyes from the clouds in the sky to the faint shadows they cast on the ground, Tal wondered if the sad note the sight struck in the pit of his stomach was something people in other habitats, ones without the size and volume to allow such environmental features to occur, ever felt.\nOne such shadow, on the opposite side of the street from him, surrounded a trio of people at the mouth of an alley. One of them was a young man wearing normal street clothes and a heavy pack slung across his back and the other two were Aegis Online security officers, resplendent in their corporate uniforms and guns on their thighs.\nTheir heated discussion revolved around the officers getting a look in the man\u0026rsquo;s pack. He swore he had nothing of value or legal concern, telling them they didn\u0026rsquo;t have any right to search him without cause, or a warrant, but his knowledge of legal rights only seemed to annoy and egg them on. The two officers flanked the young man, standing at just the right angles to prevent him running from them, unless he chose to turn down the alley which, after an obviously animated exchange, he did.\nOne of the Aegis personnel pushed the\u0026nbsp; young man on the shoulder, saying something to him that Tal couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear due to the noise of a passing truck, and by the time the vehicle had passed and he could see the scene again, the guards were chasing him down the alley at a sprint. As he watched, one of the guards looked over his shoulder, seeking signs of pursuit. The look on his face was one of ill intent, and as he looked back where he was going, his hand withdrew the large handgun from his thigh holster.\nTal clenched his jaw, watching the scene. His need to never let bullies get away with it twinged as the situation played itself out in front of him. Drawing his hands from his pockets again, he looked at his abnormal digits and visions of his childhood around \u0026ldquo;normal\u0026rdquo; kids in the schoolyard played themselves out in his memories. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t the only one who had obvious genetic tweaks, but many others carried the benefit of looking scary. Horns, teeth, bony, armored knuckles or joints, any number of other things that, on balance, gave their owners a tactical advantage in any average schoolyard bullying scenario.\nThen there had been Tal, with his missing digits. Not nearly enough to make him amazing, or frightening, but still different enough to warrant singling out and persecuting. That was why he took to the cross-country and academic teams so readily. On the cross-country team, he could knuckle under and just run away from the competition, just like he\u0026rsquo;d grown up doing on the playground. The academic kids gave him less trouble, being more accepting of physical differences when the minds attached to them could keep up with, or exceed their own. Plus, he could better keep his deformity out of their perception.\nYears of running away and being bullied had impressed upon him one thing more than any other though. As he\u0026rsquo;d matured into a young man, he\u0026rsquo;d developed a severe lack of tolerance for bullies. In his junior and senior years, he\u0026rsquo;d spent more time chatting with the dean about life, the universe, and everything than he had in his classes some weeks, because his over-developed sense of justice for the little person had landed him in an increasing number of fights. Less for his own self-esteem of late, however, because he had long since found his own worth and carved out his own place in the social strata. But the new kids. The young kids. They needed to know that bullies could be stood up to, that the little guy could come out on top. His parents hated it, but they grudgingly accepted it, not having any other real course of action aside from putting him out on the street, which they would never do.\nIt was that over-developed sense of justice that propelled him forward. Seeing the stranger being bullied by authority figures would have been enough, but the fact that the bullies bore the plumage of the company that had just turned him out for no reason other than his hands looking a little different put it over the top for him. With barely a glance at traffic, he sprinted across the street and down the alley after the trio, his years as a runner for his school closing the distance between himself and the others at a steady pace, and his years of scrapping with bullies preparing him for what was likely going to be a rough encounter.\nThe alley was clean and clear for as long as it was in view of the street, but it soon took a turn to one side and quickly became a corridor filled with refuse and too-dark shadows that could easily conceal any number of dangers. As he ran toward the trio, the stink of refuse, sickening sweet, with an edge of decay, tickled Tal\u0026rsquo;s nose. Moving with every ounce of haste he could muster, Tal called up his computer interface and set it to record through the camera in his comm link. Waiving off the interface, he named the link in his ear so the camera could get a good view of whatever he was looking at and skidded to a halt a few paces behind the others. They were so focused on one another that they gave no indication of having noticed him.\nThe guards caught up with the man with the pack, knocking him to the ground, and the one with his weapon drawn shot him in the lower leg with no apparent provocation aside from him having run away. The shot was quiet, obviously an electromagnetic accelerator set to low velocity mode to conceal the sound. Tal had fired a few at the range with his father and he knew that, while the projectiles were small, they would still do significant damage to a person\u0026rsquo;s muscles and tissue, even in low velocity mode.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s what you get for running from us, smartass,\u0026rdquo; the man with the gun shouted down at the wounded figure.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, give us your pack, or we\u0026rsquo;ll finish you off and leave you in one of these dumpsters with all the other garbage, damn Dissident,\u0026rdquo; his friend announced, securing in Tal\u0026rsquo;s mind the difference between science perfecting the form and function of the human body, and the human mind. While these jerks were definitely physical specimens, anything they appeared to have gained as a result of their designed physiques had clearly been subtracted from their personalities, and any moral guiding compasses they may have had.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just food,\u0026rdquo; the man on the ground said, holding up his hands defensively, \u0026ldquo;for my family.\u0026rdquo; His voice was edged with panic and pain, but his eyes darted around the alley, looking for anything that might help. They fell almost immediately on Tal, but strangely, did not linger on him for more than a heartbeat. Instead, the man turned his attention back to the armed officers and raised his hands farther, wincing against the pain in his leg as he moved.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, that\u0026rsquo;s just too bad,\u0026rdquo; the man with the gun said.\n\u0026ldquo;Because if you don\u0026rsquo;t have anything of value, then you aren\u0026rsquo;t really worth much, are you?\u0026rdquo; the other said, drawing his own gun and moving the selector switch to low velocity mode.\n\u0026ldquo;And Dissidents who aren\u0026rsquo;t worth much don\u0026rsquo;t live very long lives, do they?\u0026rdquo; the first man finished.\n\u0026ldquo;Look,\u0026rdquo; the wounded man said, slowly pulling the pack from his back and making sure to keep his hands where they could see them as he moved. Both guards trained their weapons on him, fingers twitching over the triggers as he did so, but they did not fire.\nOpening the top of the pack, he slowly tilted it forward so everyone, including Tal, could see its contents. A variety of different food items were piled up in the pack, mostly things that required a lot of land or special environmental conditions to produce. Tal saw a couple fruits of some kind, a few cans with labels Tal couldn\u0026rsquo;t read from his distance, but which looked like normal foodstuffs to him. Beneath it all was what looked like a vacuum-packed ham.\n\u0026ldquo;See?\u0026rdquo; the man pleaded, his eyes coming to rest on Tal again and locking with his own. \u0026ldquo;Nothing but food.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sucks to be you,\u0026rdquo; the guard that had shot him sounded off. \u0026ldquo;Good thing you\u0026rsquo;re just a Dissident scumbag then. Nobody to miss you but your scumbag friends in the sewers.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And no piles of paperwork to do for shooting you, either,\u0026rdquo; the other chimed in.\nThe man\u0026rsquo;s eyes searched Tal\u0026rsquo;s, imploring him to do something. Of course, Tal had already made up his mind. The obvious bullying had been enough for that to happen, but knowing that it was taking place for no reason other than the target\u0026rsquo;s point of origin, his upbringing, got Tal\u0026rsquo;s blood boiling.\nWith little thought as to what it was, Tal stooped down and fished a long, solid piece of refuse from the garbage pile nearest him. It was a longish beam of some sort of composite material that might have once lived life as the end of a shelving unit or some kind of coat or towel rack. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know, nor did he care. All he cared about was putting a stop to the atrocity that was occurring right before his eyes. Taking a step forward, he drew the makeshift weapon back, tightening his grip and swinging the lever like a bat at the back of the closest of the guards.\nThe impact was solid, having come from behind, and the guard yelped in surprised shock and pain, doubling over and dropping his weapon to the ground. His companion swung his weapon to the side, quickly finding Tal in his sights and shouting, \u0026ldquo;Who the hell are you? Drop the weapon and get on your knees!\u0026rdquo;\nThe downed guard groaned in pain, hands and arms splayed across the pavement, his weapon mere inches from one hand, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t appear to have the wherewithal to go after it. The weapon was, unfortunately, too far from Tal to be of much use, not that he was actually thinking of picking it up. In fact, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t doing a great deal of thinking at all. If he\u0026rsquo;d actually been thinking, he would have quietly crept away from the scene and not gotten himself involved. If he\u0026rsquo;d been thinking, he would have never followed the group down the alley in the first place.\nIf he\u0026rsquo;d been thinking, he\u0026rsquo;d have just gone and got the job on the docks, like his parents had suggested.\nInstead, he was there, in a rubbish-filled dark alley, a hundred paces from the whole world knowing what was going on, yet so far away that it might as well have been a parsec of empty space.\nInstead, he found himself standing face-to-face with an angry corporate guard who had a wounded partner, a demonstrated lack of respect for private citizens, and a loaded gun pointed at his chest.\nAll of a sudden, a crappy job on the docks was sounding pretty good to Tal.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nIt all happened at once. A single, instant explosion of sound, movement, light, and pain. Looking down the barrel of the gun, Tal felt a sudden resurgence of logic tear through him. With an abruptness that suggested he truly had no idea how the lever had appeared there, his hands released their grip on the bar, dropping it with a clatter. Raising his hands to show that he had no intention of acting out further, he was about to speak when a sharp bang echoed off the enclosed space of the alley and the guard staggered to the side. An instant later, a second electric thwip sound issued forth, and Tal felt a burning sensation in his left arm. Mimicking the staggering of the guard, Tal clasped his right hand to his wounded limb and gaped at the guard, who was busy dropping to his knees, a rapidly-growing patch of red darkening his chest. A heartbeat later, he fell forward with a loud thump and lay still.\nShifting his suddenly bleary gaze to the wounded man on the ground, Tal saw him still lying there, his leg bleeding, and a smoking gun in his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit, sorry,\u0026rdquo; the man hissed. Setting the gun on the ground near him, he waved Tal over, adding, \u0026ldquo;Come here, let me patch you up.\u0026rdquo;\nIt wasn\u0026rsquo;t intentional or even a conscious thought that had Tal moving toward the man. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t cognizant of it happening until he was kneeling before him, watching his apparently deft hands pull a few small supplies from external pockets on his pack. He held up a small, silver, gun-shaped device for Tal to see and said, \u0026ldquo;This is a protein patch dispenser. It will stop the bleeding, but it\u0026rsquo;s going to hurt, and I need to look at the wound first to make sure nothing vital is damaged, okay?\u0026rdquo;\nTal nodded dumbly, allowing the stranger to yank him forward a bit harshly and fiddle with his shirt. A moment later, a searing icicle of pain lanced through his arm and up his shoulder. He tried to shrink back from the source of the pain but the man\u0026rsquo;s grip was strong and held him in place. Instead, he opted to just curse, \u0026ldquo;Ouch! Did you stick your finger in there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, sorry, checking for pieces of the bullet. Looks like it went clean through though. I think you got lucky.\u0026rdquo; As he spoke, the man picked up the patch gun and jabbed the nozzle end into Tal\u0026rsquo;s wound with no aplomb whatsoever, holding him in place when he instinctively tried to shrink away again. \u0026ldquo;Almost there, kid. Hang on a sec.\u0026rdquo;\nTal blinked at the man, shaking his head. \u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Just this guy, you know?\u0026rdquo; he replied.\n\u0026ldquo;And you\u0026rsquo;re really just buying groceries?\u0026rdquo; Tal asked, trying to ignore the desire to shudder childishly at the feeling of the thick paste that was being injected into his suddenly more-porous-than-usual upper arm. It did its job though, cutting off the bleeding and anesthetizing the wound track. The pain lessened with every hammering heartbeat.\n\u0026ldquo;I was today,\u0026rdquo; the man shrugged. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s never good to waste a trip, you know. So I pick up a few in-demand items before I head back out after a job. Here, this is for the pain.\u0026rdquo;\nAs he spoke, the man produced a small injector and, grabbing Tal\u0026rsquo;s arm, pressed it against his skin and pushed the button. Their eyes met for a second and Tal thought he saw something there. Something sad, maybe? Concern for the future?\nTal groaned. What used to be his future, as bleak and unappetizing as it was shaping up to be, had just been flushed down the waste disposal on the belief that it had been to protect an innocent man. Suddenly, that wasn\u0026rsquo;t what had happened at all, and he was watching his future change to one of misery and constant running right before his eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Dammit,\u0026rdquo; he cursed, shoulders slouching.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, kid,\u0026rdquo; the man attempted to assuage his fears. \u0026ldquo;You did what you thought was right, and I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be alive if you hadn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; As he spoke, the man rolled up his leg to get access to his own bullet wound.\nTal hadn\u0026rsquo;t realized that he\u0026rsquo;d been released, and looked down at his shoulder to see a strangely colored lump sticking out of his fresh, new bullet wound. It looked like some form of colossal zit, waiting to be popped, framed by the dark red, still wet blood on his arm and shirt. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, and look what it got me. Accessory to murder of a Conglomerate Employee. I\u0026rsquo;ll be lucky to get a quick death when they convict me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not true,\u0026rdquo; the man said, jamming the protein patch gun into his own bullet wound. Gritting his teeth to bite back the pain of the activity, he pulled the trigger and winced as the wound track filled with thick, spongy goop.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Tal looked at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Think about it,\u0026rdquo; the man shrugged. \u0026ldquo;That one\u0026rsquo;s dead, so he isn\u0026rsquo;t telling anyone what happened, and this one never saw you. If you leave now, nobody but us will know what happened, and I am sure as heck not going to tell anyone.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Neither will I, I swear!\u0026rdquo; Tal blubbered, hope for the future returning in a sudden rush.\n\u0026ldquo;But I will,\u0026rdquo; the second guard groaned. The pair looked toward the voice and watched as the man pressed a few controls on his holographic wrist computer. \u0026ldquo;In fact, I just did,\u0026rdquo; he added, reaching for his gun as he rolled up onto his side to face them with it.\nThe stranger acted at the same time, picking up his own gun and bringing it to bear as the guard moved. Tal\u0026rsquo;s hands reflexively moved to his ears to drown out the noise he knew was coming. A second later, two shots rang out, one loud and crisp, the explosion of a shaped charge with a bullet embedded in it, and the other quiet and electric, the sound of an electromagnetic rail accelerator moving a slug of metal. An eerie quiet followed the cacophony, and Tal slowly opened his eyes, not realizing that he\u0026rsquo;d closed them, looking at the guard who was sporting a neat little hole in his forehead, right between his eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Should have checked the other guy,\u0026rdquo; the stranger\u0026rsquo;s voice panted, thin and dry.\nTal looked toward him, after a monumental effort to tear his eyes from the horror of the dead man whose hollow eyes were still fixed on him. The stranger\u0026rsquo;s breathing was quick and shallow, coming in micro-gasps that Tal was all too familiar with from watching entirely too many action videos in his spare time. There was a patch of red on his right breast, growing larger by the second, and a trickle of blood trailed from the corner of his mouth.\n\u0026ldquo;Always check the other guy \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo; he coughed, eyes closing in sudden agony.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m calling an ambulance,\u0026rdquo; Tal said, reaching for his wrist computer.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it\u0026rsquo;s too late. Be dead before they get here,\u0026rdquo; the man gasped.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t know that,\u0026rdquo; Tal said. \u0026ldquo;How could you possibly know that?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Can feel it \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo; he said, a shuddering cough wracking his body. \u0026ldquo;Bullet\u0026rsquo;s in my lung. Besides, the hospital won\u0026rsquo;t treat me. I\u0026rsquo;m not a citizen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s crap,\u0026rdquo; Tal spat. \u0026ldquo;There has to be somewhere \u0026mdash; \u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No time,\u0026rdquo; the man said, fumbling at his pocket uselessly. His eyes locked on Tal\u0026rsquo;s, asking him to help.\nGently moving his hand away, Tal reached into the pocket on the man\u0026rsquo;s thigh and felt around until the smooth, faceted surface of a data crystal fell into his fingers. Retrieving the thing, he showed it to the dying man, eyes questioning and panic rising up his spine at the sound of a siren echoing down the alley. Looking over his shoulder quickly, the panic settled a bit when the siren began growing fainter again.\n\u0026ldquo;Take it,\u0026rdquo; the man coughed, blood staining his lips. He pressed the crystal into Tal\u0026rsquo;s hands, enfolding his own over them weakly. \u0026ldquo;Take it to Romeo \u0026hellip; Ceres. Tell him Horatio sent it \u0026hellip; Tell him I did what he asked and to let my family go \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t go to Ceres,\u0026rdquo; Tal protested. \u0026ldquo;My family \u0026mdash; \u0026rdquo; Horatio\u0026rsquo;s words slipped past him for a moment as his own problems piled up inside his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Do it, or you\u0026rsquo;re dead,\u0026rdquo; the man interrupted him, a violent cough preventing him from finishing. Recovering his breath for a moment he added, \u0026ldquo;Sorry, kid.\u0026rdquo;\nTal blinked in confusion, processing the threat for a moment before he said, \u0026ldquo;What are you talking about?\u0026rdquo;\nThen it occurred to him. The extra shot. Looking down at the mega-zit on his upper arm, with the little red spot from the injection underneath it, a shudder rolled through him. Field dressing kits contained painkillers, antibiotics, proteins, everything the body needed to get someone moving again and out of danger to locate real medical assistance. In his panic, he hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought twice about the painkiller the man had given him after the patch. But then the look in his eyes flashed through Tal\u0026rsquo;s mind. \u0026ldquo;What did you do?\u0026rdquo; he gasped, clutching at his arm.\nShaking his head, the dying man pushed the crystal toward Tal. \u0026ldquo;Like I said \u0026hellip; sorry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What did you inject me with?\u0026rdquo; Tal shrank back, falling on the pavement and looking around wild-eyed. \u0026ldquo;What the hell did you do to me? I was only trying to help!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know \u0026hellip; Needed \u0026hellip; Insurance \u0026hellip; Romeo has my wife and kid. If this doesn\u0026rsquo;t get delivered he\u0026rsquo;ll \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo; He coughed. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;re nanites. You\u0026rsquo;ve got two weeks \u0026hellip; My family has one \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo;\nClotted blood covered the man\u0026rsquo;s face and his shirt was slick and wet with it. Tal could smell the coppery tang of it in the air. It did little to make him feel sympathy for the dying man, however. It made him feel tiny, insignificant, and afraid, knowing that death was looming over this stranger, and he suddenly felt like it was deserved, no matter what sob story he poured out about his family. He was watching him die and could do nothing to prevent it. But under the circumstances, would he? Even if he could?\nCeres? He\u0026rsquo;d never been off Luna before. He wasn\u0026rsquo;t even finished with school. How could he be expected to go halfway across the Sol system to deliver something to a person he\u0026rsquo;d never met in a place he\u0026rsquo;d never been? What about his family? Certainly, with the threat of microscopic assassins swimming around in his bloodstream, his family would understand him not being home for dinner.\nShaking his head, he balled his fist up around the data crystal, glaring at the dying man, \u0026ldquo;I almost died for you, not even knowing who you are, yet you poisoned me without a second thought, even before you were shot to death.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, kid,\u0026rdquo; the man coughed again, blood spattering his lips and causing Tal to shrink farther away. \u0026ldquo;My wife and kid are more important to me than some entitled kid from Luna \u0026hellip;\u0026nbsp; Welcome to the real world. It\u0026rsquo;s harsh out here but \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, you!\u0026rdquo; a stern voice shouted from behind him, cutting off the man\u0026rsquo;s monologue.\nSpinning around to search for the origin of the sound, Tal slipped on the pavement and fell backward onto the man, who coughed again. His body sat bolt upright as Tal\u0026rsquo;s landed on it, allowing his arms to wrap around Tal and hold them together long enough for him to whisper in Tal\u0026rsquo;s ear, \u0026ldquo;Take it to Romeo. Tell him Horatio sent it, and he\u0026rsquo;ll disable the nanites and pay you what he owes me \u0026hellip; \u0026rdquo;\nAs the dying gasp filled his ears, Tal saw an armed man wearing a similar security uniform to the dead ones on the ground around him. His gun was pointed at Tal and it seemed clear there would be little chance in explaining the situation to him in any way that would end well for Tal. \u0026ldquo;Put your hands where I can see them!\u0026rdquo; he shouted.\nTal froze. Every fiber of his being was screaming out at him to get out of there. Telling him to run away as fast as he could and not stop until he was miles away. But fear paralyzed his body as if he was stuck in some kind of nightmare, the armed man stalking toward him, weapon pointed at his head. Holding his hands up in complacence, he opened his mouth to speak, but a shot rang out, stopping him short.\nThe shot exploded next to his head, filling his ear with a loud ringing that washed out everything else. The new guard staggered back, but kept his feet, his weapon dipping down to his waist and his free hand clutching at the opposite shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;Run!\u0026rdquo; the dying man wheezed, slumping against Tal\u0026rsquo;s back as the last vestiges of life leaked from his body with the word.\nThat was all Tal needed to get over his paralyzation. He lurched forward, pushing off with his feet into a dead sprint toward the wounded guard. The stranger slumped to the ground behind him, but Tal couldn\u0026rsquo;t stop to think, or even acknowledge the fact. He had to get clear of the situation and there was no time to waste. If the newcomer recovered his wits before he could get clear, then he would probably be dead in minutes.\nCharging the man, Tal watched as his gun rose once more, although the limb supporting it looked weak and shaky, a patch of crimson staining the sleeve of his uniform from beneath his other hand. He should have stopped or turned or tried to find cover, but panic, fear, and a rising sense of anger at the utter absurdity of the situation drove him forward instead. The gun raised, Tal drew nearer, propelled by his strong, runner\u0026rsquo;s legs. Another electric sizzle sounded off just as Tal\u0026rsquo;s shoulder drove into the guard\u0026rsquo;s body at a full sprint.\nHe didn\u0026rsquo;t know if the shot hit him or not. He didn\u0026rsquo;t feel it, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure he\u0026rsquo;d have felt anything with the gallons of adrenalin coursing through his system. He barely even felt the weight of the man folding over his back as they collided. He thought he might have heard a loud popping noise that may have been one or more bones breaking in one of their bodies, but he wasn\u0026rsquo;t about to stop and sort out whose it was. Instead, he spun under the weight of the man, shoving him to the side and spinning around the rest of the way to face back toward the entrance to the dead-end alley. Without looking back to see if the guard had fallen, or was trying to shoot at him again, he just barreled on, slipping around the corner and charging ahead as if the guard\u0026rsquo;s bullets were in hot pursuit.\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 2\n"

	"content": "-1-\nRayne grinned, baring her perfect white teeth with excitement, as she pressed the throttle forward through the last few notches. The engines pushed on past their normal throaty whine and into the territory of a fevered scream as the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity hurtled away from Hygea at breakneck velocity. The only thing that whined more than the ship\u0026rsquo;s hull as Rayne jerked at the controls, twisting the large vessel around the various asteroids that still shielded her home from discovery by prying eyes, was Jarvis, the shipboard computer.\n-Really, Miss Torres, I distinctly remember Captain Torres instructing you to take good care of the ship. I hardly think that burning out the new ion drives five thousand miles from home qualifies as good stewardship.-\n\u0026ldquo;Hey, Jarvis?\u0026rdquo; Rayne\u0026rsquo;s grin shifted from one of mirth to one more like that of a crazed serial killer.\n-Yes, Miss. Torres?-\n\u0026ldquo;I think you missed the part where Dad told you I am the captain of the Neophyte now \u0026mdash; \u0026rdquo;\n-Captain is an earned title, young Miss Torres. I\u0026rsquo;m afraid you are going to have to prove yourself worthy of the title before I can acknowledge you as such.-\n\u0026ldquo;So, as far as you\u0026rsquo;re concerned, I\u0026rsquo;m not the captain of this boat?\u0026rdquo; Her words were part jab and part anger, but it was difficult to tell which part was the weightier of the two, as she jerked the yoke to the left, causing the ship to twist to the port. Spiraling around an asteroid, the engines continued to protest their harsh treatment.\n-I might go so far as to acknowledge you as acting captain.-\nThe computer\u0026rsquo;s dry response seemed to attempt to defuse the situation, but Rayne saw right through his ruse.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if I weren\u0026rsquo;t captain, could I do this?\u0026rdquo;\nFlattening out the ship\u0026rsquo;s trajectory, she pointed the bow of the Neophyte toward Jupiter and, with the flip of a switch, the large red button on the side of the throttle lit up almost as brightly as her glittering blue-violet eyes.\n-Miss Torres, that is not a good idea.-\n\u0026ldquo;Captain\u0026rsquo;s prerogative, Jarvis!\u0026rdquo; She interjected as she jammed the button in with her thumb, and the ship lurched forward. The console in front of her lit up with warning lights and status indicators for the fuel remaining in the Jet Assisted Take-Off \u0026nbsp;rockets she\u0026rsquo;d just fired and the delta velocity indicators started climbing with obscene speed.\nThe acceleration pressed her lithe frame back into the newly replaced acceleration chair, and her purple and blue striped hair pooled into the headrest around her, as she listened to the sounds the ship made under stress. There was a point to what she was doing, and her parents had taught it to her over the past decade while teaching her everything she\u0026rsquo;d need to know to do the job she was now speeding toward. Her very first solo run.\nShe\u0026rsquo;d be damned if she was about to go into the unknown, even if it was supposed to be a \u0026ldquo;milk run\u0026rdquo;, without knowing every weld and every bolt in her ship. Rayne needed to open the taps up and see what the Serendipity would \u0026mdash; and could \u0026mdash; do. She had just overseen the ship\u0026rsquo;s refit and this was her first opportunity to get behind the stick and test out many of the new and updated systems working together in real-time. She knew there was always going to be that one time that she\u0026rsquo;d need to give it more than was safe, and she needed to know how far past safe the vessel could go without killing her.\nPlus, there was the added benefit of annoying Jarvis with her apparent recklessness. The computer was like a member of her family. She\u0026rsquo;d grown up aboard the Serendipity, making runs with her parents, hiding in the superstructure and crawling through the service ducts. She\u0026rsquo;d probably rebuilt the ship more times than her father had since he\u0026rsquo;d bought it at auction more than thirty years before. She liked Jarvis, but to her, he was more like an annoying, know-it-all, older brother than a sagely parental figure.\n-Miss Torres, I must insist that you disengage the JATO rockets and throttle back the main engines immediately. I am reading harmonic build-up in the engine pylons and the navigational shields are experiencing power fluctuations along the starboard dorsal fuselage. If you persist in this activity, the starboard inboard engine will trigger the safety shut-off in thirty seconds.-\n\u0026ldquo;Is that what that sound is?\u0026rdquo; Rayne forced her acceleration-squished face into something resembling a grin, as she jabbed at Jarvis. Even so, she tuned her preternatural senses into the sounds the ship was making, taking special care to listen for the sounds of the stressing pylon on the indicated engine. Her pointed ears twitched a bit. They were nothing like the long, tapered ears of her mother, but they were definitely more than human, and although she had more conscious control over hers than her mother did, they still occasionally got away from her and betrayed her emotions to those who knew what to look for.\nStill, they had their benefits, and an ability to hear into the subsonic and supersonic ranges was definitely one of them. Closing her eyes, she turned her entire attention to the sounds of the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity, even drowning out Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s incessant countdown to their apparently imminent doom.\nAs he hit ten seconds, her ears at last separated the stressing groans of the pylon from the rest of the creaks and moans the vessel was making. That was the weak point. Now she knew it. And more, she knew what it sounded like on the verge of failure. And what the rest of the ship felt like when it was under stress.\nTensing her hands on the controls, she waited for Jarvis to reach two, then yanked back on the throttle, releasing the JATO button and opening her eyes to watch the glassy instrument panel\u0026rsquo;s red lights fade back through orange and into yellow. The acceleration stopped and the ship settled down into something resembling normal flight operations mode.\nScanning her eyes across the board, she smiled as all of the previously screaming indicators slipped back down into shades of green and the screaming engines wound back down into their normal whine. Leaning forward, she pulled herself free of the conforming, gel-filled acceleration seat and swept her hands over the controls, checking the ship\u0026rsquo;s systems in more detail, while Jarvis told her off.\n-I feel I must tell you that it is my duty to inform Captain Torres of your actions, young Miss Torres. Your behavior is irresponsible and self-destructive. I have been charged with your safety, and the safety of this ship, and I cannot in good conscience ignore the actions you have taken here today.-\n\u0026ldquo;Jarvis?\u0026rdquo;\n-Yes, Miss Torres?- he politely asked, as if he hadn\u0026rsquo;t just berated her.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you for informing me of Miss Torres\u0026rsquo;s behavior. I shall take it under advisement when I perform her mission debriefing after the job is done.\u0026rdquo;\n-I suspect you understand my meaning, Miss Torres,- the computer snarked.\n\u0026ldquo;I do, and I suspect that even a stubborn old goat like you was able to understand it when my dad told you I was Captain of the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity now.\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a long pause before the computer responded to her words, and when he finally did, his response seemed carefully crafted.\n-I acknowledge Captain Torres\u0026rsquo;s decision, and his order to me, to treat you as I would him. Just bear in mind that you do not own this ship, yet.-\n\u0026ldquo;I know I don\u0026rsquo;t own her yet, Jarvis. But I did rebuild her, and any fresh refit needs a shake-down. And are you telling me that this is how you talk to my dad?\u0026rdquo; she chuckled.\nAgain, a lengthy silence filled the bridge before Jarvis spoke. -Your parents and I have an unconventional relationship. I am given to understand that most shipboard artificial intelligences are not afforded as much leeway as I have been.-\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re almost certainly right about that,\u0026rdquo; she replied, finishing her system checks and punching in a more definitive course for Io. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll be mine soon enough, Jarvis,\u0026rdquo; she added.\n-Not if you destroy her with your irresponsible actions,- Jarvis warned.\n\u0026ldquo;You know I would never do that,\u0026rdquo; Rayne\u0026rsquo;s face soured. \u0026ldquo;I all but built this ship.\u0026rdquo;\n-Perhaps you should bear that in mind the next time you feel it necessary to break it.-\nAs soon as she had Io in her charts, she locked in the autopilot and pulled herself completely out of the acceleration chair, stretching her arms up over her head and arching her spine as she worked the stretch down through her muscles. \u0026ldquo;I hear ya,\u0026rdquo; she intoned. \u0026ldquo;Which shield emitters were having trouble?\u0026rdquo;\n-Starboard side, dorsal section. Emitters one-eleven through one-thirty. Fluctuations varied across the group but were between ten and sixty percent plus or minus.-\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; she groaned, finishing her stretch and cracking her neck with her left hand. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll go down and have a look if you can keep an eye on things here for a bit.\u0026rdquo;\n-Of course,- he confirmed.\nTurning to walk off the bridge, Rayne untied the sleeves of her jumpsuit from her waist and shrugged her arms into them, pulling the zip up to her neck as the doors slid closed behind her. On her way to the lower service ducts, she stopped in the captain\u0026rsquo;s cabin, her cabin, to pick up her tool belt from the locker in the corner. Taking a moment to secure the belt around her waist, she swung her gaze over the room, large for such an old vessel, but certainly not luxurious. She had yet to really add any personal touches, but she did manage to clean all of her parents\u0026rsquo; junk out before taking off.\nThe king-sized bed stood in the center of one wall, with a water closet in one corner of the opposite wall. In the other corner of the same wall was the locker that held her tools and small odds and ends. Between the head and the lockers was a small table with a computer terminal on it. There sat the one extravagance she had invested in before taking off. Her new bedding. It consisted of four huge, fluffy pillows, a set of thousand-thread-count sheets, because she could really feel the difference, and her big, heavy duvet. The one her parents had given her for her twentieth birthday a few years ago.\nA smile crept across her lips at the thought that it was all hers now. The ship, the room, the business, all of it. Moving from the room, she stopped again farther down the hallway to look into the main room with its entertainment center, the galley, dining table, some comfortable chairs, and a couch. She\u0026rsquo;d called this place home as often as their place on Hygea. Riana and Vincent had raised her aboard this ship, and when they had recently decided to stop making their own runs and take some time off, she had all but begged them to not sell the Neophyte.\nIn the end, they\u0026rsquo;d completely refit the vessel, set up a couple of milk runs for her, and handed over the keys, saying that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t let go of the ship and that there was no one else they could think of to take over the helm. Their reputations were impressive, to say the least, even before considering who her mother really was. Rayne knew their names would carry weight with many of her potential clients as she developed her own business, but she also knew that she had to work to create her own reputation. \u0026nbsp;Everything had to be perfect.\nShaking off the butterflies in her stomach, she turned away from the common room and made her way into the service ducts to work on the shield emitters. Her parents had set up her first job and made a point of it being a milk run, so she had plenty of time to spend tinkering with her new ship. She\u0026rsquo;d been assured of an easy introduction into her chosen profession. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t imagine anything going wrong.\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 2\n"

	"content": "-Prologue- \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll only be gone a couple of weeks,\u0026rdquo; Darren\u0026rsquo;s mom said as she hugged him.\n\u0026ldquo;I know, mom,\u0026rdquo; Darren said, hugging her back in that non-committal way that teenagers hug their parents in public. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just a quick trip to the Ring Station. You\u0026rsquo;ve told me a dozen times.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We just want to make sure everything\u0026rsquo;s taken care of,\u0026rdquo; his dad said, clasping a hand on Darren\u0026rsquo;s shoulder and giving it a squeeze. It was no longer the delicate hand of a Digerati, but was becoming rough and grizzled, a reflection of his last few years working on the docks, loading and unloading ships. Still, there was a strength there that only a parent of many years could muster.\nThe pair of them looked ragged around the edges, harried by years of scraping together every single credit to make ends meet. Years of being turned down for every single computer job they applied for, despite the fact that they were ten times as qualified as the next best applicant. Years of being ostracized by every corporation in the system. But now, they were going to see a big-wig about a job on the ring station. It could be the opportunity they needed to get back into the scene and moving out of the slums.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be fine,\u0026rdquo; Darren said, rolling his eyes. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like you\u0026rsquo;ve never left for a few days before.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is a few weeks, honey,\u0026rdquo; his mom said. \u0026ldquo;Noel, next door, knows what\u0026rsquo;s going on. She knows to expect you if you need anything.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know, mom.\u0026rdquo; He ducked out of her embrace and pointed at the waiting shuttle, its engines spooling up on the landing pad. \u0026ldquo;You guys are gonna miss your shuttle if you keep saying goodbye.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We know, kiddo. We just want to make sure you have what you need,\u0026rdquo; his dad said, giving him a light punch on the shoulder. \u0026ldquo;No wild parties while we\u0026rsquo;re away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. and Mrs. Erricson, we need to get going.\u0026rdquo; A gold colored cybernetic hand and forearm, with intricate swirls and hand-tooled patterns winding their way from elbow to fingertips wrapped gently around Darren\u0026rsquo;s mother\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. The three of them turned to look at the sharply dressed young man it was attached to and he gave them a comforting smile as he aimed his parents toward the open hatch. \u0026ldquo;The pilot\u0026rsquo;s concerned about the engines overheating.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks Adam,\u0026rdquo; Darren\u0026rsquo;s mom responded to the young man.\n\u0026ldquo;And thank you for setting this up for us,\u0026rdquo; his dad added, eliciting an uncomfortable nod and a grunt from the man with the artificial arm.\n\u0026ldquo;Just trying to help some decent folks out,\u0026rdquo; Adam replied.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, we really appreciate it,\u0026rdquo; Darren\u0026rsquo;s mom smiled, touching Adam\u0026rsquo;s face tenderly.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, honey,\u0026rdquo; Darren\u0026rsquo;s mom said, turning to him again and smiling at him. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ve got to get going, but we\u0026rsquo;ll be back before you know it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You guys be safe,\u0026rdquo; Darren said.\n\u0026ldquo;We will,\u0026rdquo; his dad said.\nPicking up their bags, they waved to Darren again, then headed through the shuttle\u0026rsquo;s door. Darren watched as they situated their things in bins near the hatch, then smiled out the door and disappeared into the front of the ship as the door closed and sealed them inside.\n\u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mon kid, back up a bit. These things can be dangerous when taking off so you don\u0026rsquo;t want to stand too close,\u0026rdquo; Adam said, resting his intricately decorated cybernetic hand on Darren\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. Together they took a few steps back as the shuttle\u0026rsquo;s engines started to whine. They glowed brightly, venting hot thrust down toward the platform and the ship began to rise up off the platform.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nDarren woke up panting and in a cold sweat. Every night since his parents had died, he\u0026rsquo;d woken up the same way, although, to this day, he still couldn\u0026rsquo;t actually remember what happened. He\u0026rsquo;d seen the news footage, and the security and crowd camera rolls as well, but his own memory of what happened was as blank as a powerless holographic display. His dreams, he assumed, were of that fateful event, but even though they woke him with a start every day before daylight, he could never remember them. Just the feelings of anger, sadness, and uncertainty that accompanied them.\nRunning his hands through his short brown hair he looked across his tiny apartment and locked his eyes on those of his reflection in the mirror by the bathroom door.\n\u0026ldquo;One day at a time,\u0026rdquo; he recited the litany that had dragged him through the decade since his parents\u0026rsquo; deaths. \u0026ldquo;A couple more good jobs and I can walk away.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ndash;Next Chapter\u0026ndash;\n"

	"content": "Changes, adjustments, and missed material from the Kalijor RPG Core Book.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\nThe base target number to resist anything is 12, unless otherwise stated. Many poisons/toxins, abilities, spells, and other effects will have a different target, but if they do, it will be specifically called out in their descriptions. If they say \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; then the number to beat is 12.\nSimilarly, in Kalijor, all pure spell casters (Mage, Cleric, Druid, Shaman, Geomancer) get a bonus of +1 to the target resist of their spells at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, and every three (3) levels thereafter. Hybrid classes (Templar, Ranger, Spell-Sword) receive a bonus of +1 to the target resist of their spells at levels 10, 20, and every five (5) levels thereafter.\nIn the future, all Psi-Line characters gain a bonus of +1 to the target resist of their abilities at levels 5, 10, 15, 20, and every three (3) levels thereafter.\nThis means that a 15th level Mage, or Psi-Line character can use the same abilities as a 1st level character, but their abilities are honed to the point that targets must roll a 15 or better to resist their effects, rather than the standard 12.\nIn the racial descriptions for Kalijor, the human is described as having 1D6x10+60 attribute pool points, but it should be the same 2D6x10+60 as Base-Line Humans in the future setting.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\nIn the consumer and military pressure suits and hard armors section (page 237 in the retail version but may be a couple pages off from earlier versions due to formatting changes), we missed a few of the Physical Health and soak values during revisions. the finalized info is as follows:\nClass 1 consumer pressure suit\nThis suit is a \u0026lsquo;soft\u0026rsquo; suit that is designed for nothing more than protection against the frigid vacuum of space. Built-in air supply is good for 8 hours.\nPhysical Health: 50\nSoak: 1\nProwl Penalty: None\nArmor Class: Light Pressure Suit\nCost: 500 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass 2 consumer pressure suit\nThis suit is designed for more industrial/work related activities. Intended for those who work outside habitable areas on the surfaces of planets and planetoids. Its surfaces are reinforced with some armored plates to protect against minor damage and tumbles although it is still considered to be a \u0026lsquo;soft\u0026rsquo; armor. Built-in air supply is good for 8 hours.\nPhysical Health: 75\nSoak: 3\nProwl Penalty: -5\nArmor Class: Medium Pressure Suit\nCost: 850 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass 3 consumer pressure suit\nThis suit is designed to be used while in open space for long periods of time. It is reinforced for protection against collision of micro-meteors and other space debris, which also affords it some minor protection against small arms fire. This suit is considered to be \u0026lsquo;hard\u0026rsquo; armor and its built-in air supply is good for 10 hours. Additionally, this armor is equipped with as many as 25 tiny maneuvering jets that allow the wearer to make getting around in the vacuum of space much easier and more efficient. These jets are not designed for sustained travel, but rather for turning, adjusting attitude and making short trips between structures/ships (add +5 to the zero-g movement skill).\nPhysical Health: 100\nSoak: 5\nProwl Penalty: -10\nArmor Class: Heavy Pressure Suit\nCost: 1,500 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass 1 military pressure suit\nThis suit is not only designed for use in an airless environment, but it has also been reinforced on all major surfaces with composite materials and plates that protect against a moderate amount of weapons fire. The built-in air supply is good for 10 hours.\nPhysical Health: 45\nSoak: 5\nProwl Penalty: -5\nArmor Class: Medium Pressure Suit\nCost: 2,500 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass 2 military pressure suit\nMore or less just a beefed up version of the class 1 military suit, this system offers more protection against damage as well as an increase in air supply. Built-in air supply is good for 12 hours. Additionally, this armor is equipped with as many as 25 tiny maneuvering jets that allow the wearer to make getting around in the vacuum of space much easier and more efficient. These jets are not designed for sustained travel, but rather for turning, adjusting attitude and making short trips between structures/ships (add +5 to the zero-g movement skill).\nPhysical Health: 65\nSoak: 6\nProwl Penalty: -10\nArmor Class: Heavy Pressure Suit\nCost: 4,500\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass 3 military pressure suit\nThis suit affords its wearer the maximum amount of protection without actually getting them into a suit of powered or robot armor. Built-in air supply is good for 18 hours. Additionally, this armor is equipped with as many as 25 tiny maneuvering jets that allow the wearer to make getting around in the vacuum of space much easier and more efficient. These jets are not designed for sustained travel, but rather for turning, adjusting attitude and making short trips between structures/ships (add +5 to the zero-g movement skill).\nPhysical Health: 85\nSoak: 7\nProwl Penalty: -15\nArmor Class: Heavy Pressure Suit\nCost: 9,000 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass A consumer hard armor\nThis armor is designed as an under-clothes body protection against minor small arms fire. It is only good for absorbing a few rounds and normally must be discarded after it takes fire, rather than being repaired. Because the armor only covers a portion of the body it\u0026rsquo;s ability to soak damage is reduced.\nPhysical Health: 40\nSoak: 2\nProwl Penalty: None\nArmor Class: Light Armor\nCost: 400 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass B consumer hard armor\nSimply a beefed up version of the Class A armor, this piece will still fit under normal clothing without looking terribly conspicuous.\nPhysical Health: 65\nSoak: 3\nProwl Penalty: -5\nArmor Class: Medium Armor\nCost: 1,200 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass C consumer hard armor\nThis armor is designed to protect the wearer from a much more significant amount of weapons fire. It includes a helmet, shoulder, forearm, thigh, shin and groin protection. It is impossible to conceal this armor beneath any normal clothing although it could be mostly covered up by the use of a trench coat or cloak.\nPhysical Health: 100\nSoak: 5\nProwl Penalty: -25\nArmor Class: Heavy Armor\nCost: 5,000 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass A military hard armor\nThis piece of armor is designed as a concealable vest for use in public, under-cover operations. It provides a minimum level of protection for its wearer but it is still better than the civilian version.\nPhysical Health: 50\nSoak: 3\nProwl Penalty: None\nArmor Class: Light Armor\nCost: 5,500 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass B military hard armor\nThis armor comes in the form of a chest piece with shoulder, thigh, shin, forearm and groin protection and is designed for maximum flexibility and minimum encumbrance.\nPhysical Health: 85\nSoak: 4\nProwl Penalty: None\nArmor Class: Medium Armor\nCost: 7,500 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass C military hard armor\nThis suit is a more robust, environmentally sealed suit that is good for use in airless environments should the need arise. Built-in air supply is good for 6 hours.\nPhysical Health: 100\nSoak: 6\nProwl Penalty: -15\nArmor Class: Medium Environmental Armor\nCost: 10,200 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\nClass D military hard armor\nThis is as tough as generic personal armor gets. This suit comes equipped with heavy reinforcing at all of the major joints, is environmentally sealed with a 10 hour air supply and provides the wearer with minor motor-assistance in order to compensate for the weight and bulk of the suit itself.\nPhysical Health: 200\nSoak: 8\nProwl Penalty: -50\nArmor Class: Heavy Environmental Armor\nCost: 50,000 credits\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\n"

	"content": "Brushing a lock of dark purple hair behind her long pointed ear, even as it twitched with agitation, Riana looked out at the transparent dome keeping Neo-Tokyo\u0026rsquo;s precious atmosphere inside. It was underlaid with a layer of darkening smoke that glowed slightly with the flickering light of numerous fires and the steady lights of the city beneath. Flashes of gunfire lit up swirling holes in the smokey canopy, but the multi-colored lights of emergency and fire-suppression vehicles were nowhere in sight.\nWishing for the umpteenth time that her artificial body would allow her to shed even a single tear, she continued to stare as the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity approached the orbital city.\n\u0026ldquo;What does she want?\u0026rdquo; she asked aloud, not really expecting an answer.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know, but she\u0026rsquo;s obviously willing to hurt any people she comes across in order to get whatever it is.\u0026rdquo; Lost in thought in the face of Anja\u0026rsquo;s depravity, Vincent\u0026rsquo;s tenor voice startled her. Since Anja had entered her life nearly a year ago,\u0026nbsp; she had stopped at nothing to make herself number one on the solar system\u0026rsquo;s most wanted list. She had killed hundreds of people on several worlds and then moved into Neo-Tokyo, setting the whole city ablaze. She\u0026rsquo;d rallied every thug in Neo-Tokyo to her cause and killed or chased off every peacekeeper in the city. Now she was keeping them at bay in the massive rings that connected the city to the rest of the Ring Station\u0026rsquo;s cities.\nVincent\u0026rsquo;s calm strength and unassuming demeanor always helped her feel more at ease and, in the face of Anja\u0026rsquo;s brutality, it was one of the only things keeping her grounded. Looking over the ship\u0026rsquo;s center console, she offered him a wan smile as her violet eyes took in his slim, athletic frame, crystal blue eyes and long blonde hair, restrained behind his head with a simple tie. He worked the Serendipity\u0026rsquo;s controls masterfully, even as he spared a glance toward the awful sight and offered Riana a supportive nod. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, Ree. We\u0026rsquo;ll find Kat. Then we\u0026rsquo;ll stop Anja from doing whatever it is she\u0026rsquo;s doing.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Riana nodded back at him. \u0026ldquo;Thank you.\u0026rdquo;\nSilence reigned as she turned back to the viewscreen and locked her eyes on the burning city once more, before the ship dipped below the upper rim of the platform upon which it was built. They had been cleared to land in a hanger not too far from the city, but had also been informed that all access to the city itself was cut off. No one was allowed in or out until the situation was resolved, and there was no end in sight. Of course, it was unlikely that the Conglomerate forces enforcing the blockade had any idea what Anja was up to in there, so any solution was even further afield than they would ever admit publicly.\nDropping back into the comforting embrace of her acceleration seat, Riana lay the little bull-pup sub-machine gun across her lap and inspected it for the fiftieth time. It was still loaded, clean, balanced, sights adjusted, and safety engaged. She sighed as the patch of scarred metal on the bottom came into view and she considered the meaning of that mark. It was a perfect rectangle, of course, despite the fact that she had removed the weapon\u0026rsquo;s identifying markings by hand with a laser cutter. The authorities wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care how perfectly formed the rectangle was, though. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care that she had removed the markings with surgical precision. They wouldn\u0026rsquo;t care that she had wanted to bawl like a child with a stubbed toe as she\u0026rsquo;d done it. All they would care about was that she was carrying an illegal Class C weapon without a permit. Without any diplomatic or corporate credentials.\nHer heavy sigh was not lost on Vincent, who gritted his teeth as he guided the ship to a gentle landing in the hanger and turned over the handling of the post-flight checklist to Jarvis, the artificial intelligence that was tied into every system aboard the Serendipity. Swiveling out of his own acceleration chair, he crouched next to her and took up her hand, enfolding it in his own and locking eyes with her. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, Ree. We\u0026rsquo;re going to make all of this right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know.\u0026rdquo; She smiled at him, awash in feelings whose meaning she could only begin to catalogue. This situation was so foreign to her, so alien, that she was experiencing things she never would have imagined possible even a week prior. \u0026ldquo;It just feels like everything is getting so out of hand, so quickly.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent nodded his understanding, squeezing her hand as he replied, \u0026ldquo;These are interesting times, to be sure, but we\u0026rsquo;ll get through it. Because we have each other. You, me, Kat, all of us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you, Vin. Thank you so much.\u0026rdquo; She leaned forward and pulled him into a hug before standing, securing her bull-pup to the strap dangling from her shoulder, and letting it fall beneath her fitted, prismatic duster. \u0026ldquo;Now let\u0026rsquo;s get in there and find my sister before something happens to her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you too,\u0026rdquo; he responded, standing up and watching her new resolve take shape. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the plan for getting you past customs, and us into Neo-Tokyo?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana thought for a moment, then smiled a wicked smile. \u0026ldquo;Do you remember that little caf\u0026eacute; we stopped at a few months back? The one that serves the great pierogies?\u0026rdquo;\nVincent considered her words for a moment before his eyes lit up with the memory of the short meal they had shared while they both happened to be in the area. \u0026ldquo;That was Magoun\u0026rsquo;s, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the place. Meet me there as soon as you can,\u0026rdquo; she agreed with a nod. Before anything more could be said, she closed her eyes, thinking hard about the little restaurant and willing herself to cross the distance. An instant later there was a quiet popping noise as she vanished, leaving Vincent alone on the bridge.\nShaking his head at the empty space, Vincent sighed. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I\u0026rsquo;ll ever get used to that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If it helps, Captain, I don\u0026rsquo;t think I will either,\u0026rdquo; Jarvis offered. The dry accent of the ship\u0026rsquo;s computer was at once nondescript, and yet, totally distinct.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure it does, Jarvis.\u0026rdquo; Vincent sighed again, before moving to his locker to assemble his gear.\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 2\n"

	"content": "Xavier paced across the office, hands behind his back, and shoes clicking against the transparent floor through which the rest of the Tyconderoga space station could be seen spreading out beneath the rather peculiar, vertigo-inducing office. His dark hair was pulled into a short tail at the back of his skull, and his steel-gray eyes remained fixed upon the office\u0026rsquo;s other occupants as he moved from his immense, transparent desk, to the black, leather, over-stuffed chairs where the target of his current tirade sat, quietly fuming.\n\u0026ldquo;This is absolutely unacceptable. I have already forbidden you from investigating this matter any further. Yet I am receiving reports from the server levels that you have both been down there, yet again, digging through records pertaining to the unfortunate expiration of Mr Arianas.\u0026rdquo; He finished his quiet stalk across the huge office and deftly undid the waist buttons of his silk jacket, parting it to reveal the supple, white fabric of his shirt as he sat down in the chair opposite the women.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not fair Xavier! We\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina began to protest, but Xavier cut her off with a simple, efficient raising of his right hand. She stopped speaking instantly.\n\u0026ldquo;It is not your place to determine fairness or equity Willhelmina. I should think that my decisions concerning you over the years have convinced you that I am not interested in such trivialities. My concerns are somewhat larger than you and Miss Thorindal\u0026rsquo;s personal desires.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But his death had nothing to do with a computer malfunction,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina kept her tone flat and the wild energy out of her voice. Maybe if she could play things the way he\u0026rsquo;d always tried to teach her, he would respond better. She calmly raised her own hand and brushed a lock of her jet black hair behind her ear. Focusing her emerald eyes on his steely orbs. Her lithe frame nearly disappeared into the voluminous cushions of the chair, even under her slight weight.\n\u0026ldquo;I welcome any evidence that you might present on the matter,\u0026rdquo; he seemed suddenly more interested in the conversation now that she had calmed down and sat up straight. \u0026ldquo;However, to date, the best either of you have produced is a series of verbal accounts from avatars in Kalijor, and a time-line that matches the two events. There is no computer information what-so-ever, to corroborate your theory.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina positively fumed as her mind raced to try and find some way to connect the dots so he would even consider the idea that Exodus and Jax\u0026rsquo;s deaths were linked. They\u0026rsquo;d spent more than a month digging through computer records and parsing Kalijor log files despite Xavier\u0026rsquo;s repeated demands that they stop. Finally, he\u0026rsquo;d had their access to the server levels revoked (which meant no more game pods while entering Kalijor), and a decrease in both of their courier salaries.\n\u0026ldquo;I need to see Wayne,\u0026rdquo; Riana cut in, causing both of the others to swivel their heads around to look at her. She ran her fingers through her long, dark purple hair, revealing her thin, tapered ears that were twitching slightly with a sort of barely-contained annoyance at the entire situation.\n\u0026ldquo;I presume you are speaking about Doctor Nelson?\u0026rdquo; Xavier raised an eyebrow. \u0026ldquo;Is there something wrong with your body?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Riana confirmed, narrowing her violet eyes, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m having difficulty restraining myself from choking you to death.\u0026rdquo; She didn\u0026rsquo;t so much as twitch while she spoke. Neither did Xavier.\nWillhelmina however, had trouble closing her mouth after her jaw dropped in surprise. \u0026ldquo;Ree\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she began, but was cut off by Xavier, who\u0026rsquo;s voice was fast approaching that level of irritation that seemed to be the thin line between his impossible calm, and his irate, explosive yelling that only Riana seemed to be able to bring out from him.\n\u0026ldquo;Miss Thorindal, that is highly inappropriate. Please remember your place here amongst us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My place? You mean the fact that you\u0026rsquo;ve stuffed my mind into this borrowed body and keep me on a leash like some sort of animal on a chain? Or do you mean my place as in the fact that I\u0026rsquo;ve willingly turned myself into your obedient little hit-woman just to keep my only flesh and blood relative out of trouble?\u0026rdquo; Riana glared at him.\nWillhelmina continued to gasp, having trouble getting her voice back under control as the war escalated. But much to her surprise, it was Xavier that broke first this time. Riana sat cooly in her chair, sunk all the way to the bottom in the cushion as her deceptively heavy frame pushed all of the supporting material aside. Meanwhile, Xavier had moved his hands to the arm rests of his own chair and pulled himself forward, almost violently, narrowing his eyes at her and seething slightly as he responded.\n\u0026ldquo;Your place, as in the fact that you are a guest here. At best. At worst, you are a few pounds of meat on a coroner\u0026rsquo;s table and a bin full of spare parts and computer equipment. Be careful what you say to me Miss Thorindal. I do not suffer disobedience lightly, especially from my employee\u0026rsquo;s research projects.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Research projects eh?\u0026rdquo; Riana\u0026rsquo;s lips curled into a tiny smirk. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s been a while now Xavier. A couple years, in point of fact, that your little research project has been running around, making trouble for you. Isn\u0026rsquo;t it about time to pull the plug? To consign it\u0026rsquo;s artificial mind to the dark abyss?\u0026rdquo;\nFor an instant, it seemed as if Xavier was about to stand bolt upright and unload another round of screaming at the purple-haired elf, but he seemed to suddenly get control of himself and his entire body relaxed as he picked up his cup of tea from the table and sank back into the chair with a quietly appreciative smile spreading across his face. \u0026ldquo;Nicely done Miss Thorindal.\u0026rdquo; He sipped at his tea with a thoughtful expression writ across his face. \u0026ldquo;That was faster than usual, and you didn\u0026rsquo;t even lean forward in your chair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ve been learning from the master,\u0026rdquo; Riana replied, her smirk turning into a full-blown, mischievous smile. She leaned her head back against the chair and stared out into space through the transparent dome that was the top of his office. Taking a few long, calming breaths, she looked back toward him and added, \u0026ldquo;Why are you stone-walling us on this?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have my reasons,\u0026rdquo; he still sounded upset, but was doing a much better job of controlling himself.\n\u0026ldquo;But we know there is a connection between these scientists, and what happened to Jax,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina finally recovered her voice enough to rejoin the conversation.\n\u0026ldquo;You suspect,\u0026rdquo; he corrected her with a glance in her direction, but his eyes quickly snapped back to Riana\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;We came to you with all of the data about the excessive sub-space domain usage coming from Kalijor. We came to you with the time data that corresponds to the deaths of Jax Arianas and Exodus, both the same mind, in two different worlds, simultaneous down to the pico-second. We supplied you with recorded conversations of people telling us what Shantal was up to, and who he was tracking down, and that list is not only short, but extremely specialized in the area of cybernetics and sub-space domain manipulation. All of the evidence, while admittedly a bit spotty, points to the fact that not only are there links between Kalijor and the real world, but people are learning how to manipulate those links and cause effects in the real world by initiating actions in Kalijor.\u0026rdquo; Riana still managed to keep her voice calm and controlled. Something her \u0026lsquo;sister\u0026rsquo; Willhelmina, was still having trouble with this round.\n\u0026ldquo;Why won\u0026rsquo;t you let us look into this, even on our own time?\u0026rdquo; She implored.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you agreed to be couriers for Solidarity Online, which means you no longer have anything even remotely similar to \u0026lsquo;your\u0026rsquo; time. In fact, I have another assignment for you.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina bristled, but remained silent. He was right. As long as they worked for him as couriers, they basically had no time of their own, unless they were on leave. And even then, they could technically be called back to work on no notice at all.\nRiana managed to keep hold of her calm, her ears twitching slightly, then drooping a bit as her eyes narrowed. \u0026ldquo;And what is the assignment this time? Another tiny little corporation getting too involved in sub-space domain management? Or making their processors too powerful for your liking? Maybe another para-military commando unit that needs to be erased?\u0026rdquo;\nThis time it was Xavier\u0026rsquo;s turn to smile triumphantly. While the game between himself and Riana had changed slightly over the last couple of years, the end goal remained unchanged: see who could incite the other to showing their anger first. And there was no surer way to incite Riana than to talk about either her work for him, or to threaten her family, which now, for some unfathomable reason, seemed to include his ward, Willhelmina. \u0026ldquo;Actually, it is a simple pick-up and return.\u0026rdquo;\nHe sipped at his tea before continuing, \u0026ldquo;Your recent activity on Luna has endangered the work of Doctor Hakiro Yamato in Tranquility. I have set up quarters, and a lab, for him here aboard The Tyconderoga and I want you two to go and retrieve him, and his processor prototypes, and bring them back here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That business was all Daray, Xavier, we were just helping out, and you sent us in on it,\u0026rdquo; Riana groused. She hated the fact that he made every situation sound as if it were her fault when he spoke. Daray was an awesome person, and so were Lana, Alina, and Melissa. They\u0026rsquo;d inadvertently involved Doctor Yamato in their business when they\u0026rsquo;d tapped him to help Daray and APRIL get their minds sorted out after some mad psychic called Turin had scrambled them inside Daray\u0026rsquo;s head. \u0026ldquo;And, it was settled well enough. There isn\u0026rsquo;t going to be any fallout.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perhaps not. However, Doctor Yamato\u0026rsquo;s work has progressed to the point where it will be necessary for him to be closer to home for the foreseeable future,\u0026rdquo; he gave her the benefit of the doubt.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine. Timeframe?\u0026rdquo; She schooled her expression into a more business-like appearance.\n\u0026ldquo;You will leave presently. I\u0026rsquo;ve ordered The Kestrel prepared for departure within the hour.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina raised her arm to examine the holographic display of her wrist computer for the current time while Riana silently called the information up on her internal computer system, the time and date appearing in the heads up display superimposed over everything she saw.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s less than twenty minutes!\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina complained.\n\u0026ldquo;Then I suppose you had better get moving. You are cleared for Class B weapons and resistance should be minimal to non-existent.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And this doesn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do with the fact that Hakiro Yamato is on the list of people that Gregory Shantal is looking for?\u0026rdquo; Riana asked as she stood up in an impossibly fluid movement, considering how deeply imbedded she had been in the chair.\nAs usual, it took Willhelmina several attempts to get free of her own seat, the deep cushions refusing to let her go without considerable effort.\n\u0026ldquo;It does not,\u0026rdquo; Xavier replied. \u0026ldquo;Please, have a safe voyage.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana placed a hand on Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s shoulder and hoisted her up out of the chair, then the two of them turned away from Xavier and headed for the vertigo-inducing U-bend hallway that led back to the bulk of the station.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I thought that went rather well,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina said sourly as the door closed behind them and they navigated the sickening turn in the hallway.\n\u0026ldquo;In what way?\u0026rdquo; Riana asked, her ears perking up.\n\u0026ldquo;That was sarcasm, Ree.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh,\u0026rdquo; Riana considered that for a moment, then her expression brightened slightly and she replied, \u0026ldquo;well at least we know he\u0026rsquo;s moving to keep these people out of Shantal\u0026rsquo;s reach.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do we know that? He said he wanted him closer to his projects here,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina commented as she adjusted her skin-tight outfit to show her toned body off to best effect for the rest of the station.\nRiana raised an eyebrow at her as Willhelmina primped herself. Shaking her head slightly, she responded, \u0026ldquo;Hakiro Yamato\u0026rsquo;s work can be done from anywhere. He designs hardware and uploads specs for fabrication.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But then they need to be tested right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In theory, but the bulk of testing is done in virtual space, before parts are ever built. Rarely is any of his gear fabricated if it isn\u0026rsquo;t already 100% in design phase.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So we can infer that Xavier is relocating him as a safety measure, not as a project related need.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, so my other question is, how the heck do you know all this stuff? Since when do you know anything about hardware fabrication and personnel allocation?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana gave her sister a hard stare and shook her head again. \u0026ldquo;Kat, I don\u0026rsquo;t need more than a couple hours of sleep a week. Master Jonin can\u0026rsquo;t spar with me at all hours of the day and night, and I get stuck on station more than a little bit.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So?\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina screwed up her face as they exited the lift and headed for their personal quarters to gather a few things before the trip.\n\u0026ldquo;So, I read. A lot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I read quite a bit. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t spout half the things you just came up with,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina whined.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t have a computer-enhanced brain. I can read a half dozen books at the same time and remember every single word.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina stopped in front of her door and looked at Riana a bit wistfully. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Ree.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;For what?\u0026rdquo; Riana stopped half way to her own door and looked back at her sister, ears rising up in curiosity.\n\u0026ldquo;For never giving you a choice,\u0026rdquo; she breathed.\nRiana considered the words for a moment, not entirely sure of what she was talking about, but there were several applicable events in their past. Finally, she shrugged and smiled, \u0026ldquo;you know, Kat. We\u0026rsquo;ve been sisters my entire life. I\u0026rsquo;d do anything for you. Don\u0026rsquo;t beat yourself up alright? You\u0026rsquo;ve never once forced me to do anything I couldn\u0026rsquo;t have backed away from.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina looked at her friend for another long moment, before smiling and waving her hand in front of the panel to open her door. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll catch you in a few. I\u0026rsquo;m going to grab a shower before lift-off.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana nodded, watching her sister disappear into her rooms, and waiting until the door was closed behind her before she waved her way into her own room.\nShe could hear Willhelmina crying in the shower through the walls as she packed her few things for the trip. \u0026ldquo;The curse of cybernetically enhanced hearing\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She mumbled to herself.\nIt had been months since Exodus and Jax had been killed, and try as she might to appear as though she were over it, Willhelmina was getting worse day by day. She put on a brazen front for everyone to see, and had even begun courting again, probably in an attempt to ease the pain. But she suspected it only made things worse.\nShe\u0026rsquo;d even gone as far as speaking to Gayle about it, but the psychologist\u0026rsquo;s advice on the subject had been to let her brood a while and just make sure she knew she had friends when she was ready to talk. Fat lot of good that had been.\nIn the end though, she really had no other choice in the matter. If she attempted to broach the subject, Kat would just get angry. If she did anything to impede her, it would be worse than yelling. So instead, she just sat back, quietly watching, and wishing she could cry her own tears, as her sister worked hard at destroying what was left of her life with Exodus.\nShe sighed again as she shouldered her little duffle and waved her way out of her rooms, headed for the landing bay so she could prep The Kestrel for take-off.\nSomething was about to give, and it wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be pretty when it did\u0026hellip;\nBack to The Fourth Key of Kalijor\n"

	"content": "A hail of bullets slipped past Riana\u0026rsquo;s lithe form as she dove behind the metallic cargo crate, rolling into a crouching position with her bull-pup machine gun held at the ready and her back to the crate. Glancing at the translucent casing of the magazine on top of her weapon, the computers in her brain told her she had twenty one rounds left to expend.\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;re we doing?\u0026rdquo; she said calmly into her comm link.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything is moving along swimmingly.\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s voice replied silkily. \u0026ldquo;Another five minutes should do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Five minutes. Right. No problem, take your time,\u0026rdquo; Riana\u0026rsquo;s voice dripped sarcasm as she looked around to see what she could use to keep her attackers occupied for a while longer. Finally, she planted her heavy boots on the floor, set her shoulders against the pressurized shipping crate and pushed with her legs.\nIt took a moment, but eventually the bottom edge of the crate came up off the floor and she redoubled her efforts, extending her legs and bringing her cybernetic strength fully to bear. Bullets continued to ricochet off the crate and the nearby wall until the ten-ton box finally toppled over.\nInstantly, the room was filled with the sound of a metal-onmetal crash, followed by the groaning of the floor and its support structure being bent and distended by the sudden impact of the immense weight. The room shook and light fixtures broke away from the ceiling, causing the lighting to change and throw strange, jagged shadows across the crowded space. Several smaller crates in the area also toppled over, only adding to the cacophony, but the constant gunfire came to an abrupt stop as the armor-clad soldiers scattered.\nWhipping around with the butt of her weapon pressed snugly into her shoulder, Riana picked out a couple of the soldiers andsqueezed off a short burst at each, the bull-pup machine gun pressing into her shoulder with each burst. The brief hail of armorpiercing slugs tore up her selected targets, driving them violently to the ground where they twitched for a moment before shuddering to stillness.\nSatisfied that she had succeeded in keeping them occupied for a few more minutes, she stripped a concussion grenade from her combat webbing and tossed it into the center of the room before dashing out of the blast radius and crouching behind another crate. Absently, she brushed a lock of royal purple hair out of her face as she stripped the spent magazine from the top of her rifle, slipping it into an empty pouch and extracting another.\nThe loud thump of the explosion washed over the room, knocking out the rest of the light fixtures in the area and bathing the scene of the battle with deep, foreboding shadows. The sound of boots scurrying and shuffling around came to her long, pointed ears as she casually set the fresh magazine on top of her weapon and slapped it down on top of the receiver, locking it into place.\nLooking over her shoulder into the shadows, she shifted her vision into the ultraviolet spectrum. Tapping her headset, she activated the UV light that was mounted next to the camera at her temple, causing the room to fall into stark relief as she scanned around for signs of her opponents.\nCatching sight of someone dashing out of the center of the blast radius, she took aim and cut loose a short burst. Her weapon belched fire as she cut the soldier down and then rolled back behind the crate as return fire homed in on her muzzle flash. Spinning toward the other edge of the crate, she peeked around the container,\nleveling her rifle and squeezing off another short burst. Her target fell to the ground clutching his stomach.\nHer long, tapered ears dropped down low as she focused on the sound of footsteps creeping up behind her, getting a fix on the person\u0026rsquo;s location. When she heard the click of a trigger being pulled, she uncoiled her legs from beneath her, launching herself into the air as a stream of projectiles passed through the space where she\nhad just been crouched. Throwing her legs over her head, she wheeled around in mid-air, grabbing the surprised soldier by the shoulder straps of his combat webbing. As her feet came back to the ground, she bent over forward, hauling the man off his feet and launching him bodily out from behind the crate. The panicked soldier crashed like a discarded rag doll into a pile of smaller containers twenty feet away, sending the metal boxes scattering in every direction. He then slumped down to the ground, motionless.\nThe clamor of the event distracted the rest of them further, allowing Riana to pick off two more as she rolled behind another crate and quickly checked her magazine again.\n\u0026ldquo;Are we done yet?\u0026rdquo; she asked calmly into her comm link as she looked carefully around the edge of her cover.\n\u0026ldquo;Two more minutes,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s voice panted back. It sounded like she was in the middle of running a marathon.\n\u0026ldquo;Having trouble?\u0026rdquo; Riana smiled as she taunted her sister.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina replied breathily. \u0026ldquo;No trouble. Just ten or twelve armed people who don\u0026rsquo;t seem to want me leaving with this thing.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s smile faded a bit as the thought of her best friend, her sister, being chased down by an armed lynch mob raced through her head. \u0026ldquo;Where are you? I can\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina cut her off, knowing full well what she was thinking of doing. \u0026ldquo;Stick to the plan Ree. I\u0026rsquo;m fine. I\u0026rsquo;ll be ready in two minutes.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; Riana growled into the comm link. \u0026ldquo;Two minutes. Mark.\u0026rdquo; She tapped the small computer on her wrist and a two minute count-down began on its tiny holographic display. A few seconds ticked off before the display went dark in order to keep her position secure. She didn\u0026rsquo;t need the wrist computer. Her brain was more than half computer as it was. But something about using the device, just like everyone else, helped her feel in some way\u0026hellip; normal.\n\u0026ldquo;Mark.\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina echoed through the comm link.\nPoking her head out from behind cover again, Riana\u0026rsquo;s ears twitched and she yanked herself back behind the crate as a storm of bullets converged on her position.\n\u0026ldquo;Took them long enough,\u0026rdquo; she mumbled to herself as she detached a smooth metal disk from the combat webbing at her hip and attached it to the crate with a dull \u0026lsquo;thunk\u0026rsquo; noise. Springing lightly up on top of the ten foot high crate, she picked off two more of the soldiers, who were taken completely by surprise at her shift to higher ground. She then dove across twenty feet of open air onto another stack of crates, slipping quietly behind some smaller boxes.\nRemoving an identical metal disk from her other hip, she attached it to one of the small crates, then stripped off another grenade and tossed it back toward the soldiers as she leapt across another huge gap. Several sprays of gun fire followed her as she arced through the air, and she felt several projectiles tear through the shimmering fabric of her long, fitted duster. The flowing garment did its job, obscuring her form and causing the bullets to miss the reactive armor covering her body like a second skin.\nSkidding to a stop behind cover, she braced her sensitive ears, clenching her jaw just as the concussion grenade exploded with a loud thump that rattled the entire room again. This time, she removed a slightly smaller metal disk from the outside of one of her knees and attached it to one of the crates she was using for cover, then jumped down to the floor and made her way to the other side of the room.\nThe group of soldiers was obviously falling apart. She passed within a foot of a pair of them and they didn\u0026rsquo;t so much as twitch at her passing, focusing instead on the area in the center of the warehouse where all of the action had been thus far. She could have easily dispatched them both, and all of their comrades as well, given\nenough time, but she hated the thought of killing people unnecessarily. She preferred to just do her job and go home.\nAs she approached the door to the room, she clicked the disk off of the outside of her other knee and attached it to a nearby crate. Tapping her wrist computer, she conjured up the holographic display and its steady countdown. One minute and thirty seconds remained. She sighed heavily as she eyed the door, then focused her attention back toward the soldiers in the center of the room. Concentrating on the sounds in the room she could hear four\u0026hellip; no, five of them moving around the area, searching for her and trying not to cut one another down in the process. Apparently, she had them pretty riled up.\nGlancing at her computer display again, it read one minute and four seconds. She eyed it as it counted down and when it hit fifty nine seconds she turned her head to the side and shouted into the room, \u0026ldquo;You have sixty seconds to get out of here, otherwise you will be leaving in a refuse bin when they clean up the mess.\u0026rdquo;\nThen, she dashed for the door and slid calmly out into the adjoining hallway. She let her bull-pup fall back to its resting place between her right arm and body, allowing it to be concealed by the shimmering fabric of her jacket.\nShe didn\u0026rsquo;t look much like the normal employees in the area, but she knew she stood a better chance of moving unhindered if she didn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be bristling with weaponry so she tugged the duster closed and moved off into the corridor. As she rounded the fourth corner between the storage room and the airlock where the Kestrel\nwas docked, she glanced down at her wrist in time to see the counter reach zero. She braced herself as a massive explosion rocked the entire station, before dashing, full speed, toward the airlock.\nOn to Chapter 2\n"

	"content": "The ship stood on end as he yanked back on the stick. To the outside observer it looked as though the sleek craft lifted it\u0026rsquo;s nose up into the air, mere feet above the landing strip, and then as he slammed the throttle forward a column of fire erupted from the wing-mounted engine nacelles and catapulted the craft straight up and out of sight so quickly that witnesses would have said it happened in an instant.\nHis instrument panel screamed out at him to stop the maneuver, but reeked of\u0026nbsp; hypocrisy as his proximity sensors screamed at him to loose the missile that somehow managed to follow him through the break-neck aerial feat. Yanking the stick to the side and adjusting the thrust vector of the ship\u0026rsquo;s nacelles, Vin rolled the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity into a tight barrel roll as it careened at suicidal speeds toward the Martian cliff face. Checking his rear display he smiled against the G-force of the spiral, the missile was an older model fire and forget, which meant it was designed to exactly mimic its target\u0026rsquo;s movements.\nSnapping his eyes forward again he eased the Neophyte out of the roll and onto its side jus tin time to scrape through the narrow crag in the face of the ruddy red cliff. With the twist of a knob on the throttle the nacelles changed direction again and he slammed the throttle forward once more. The ship\u0026rsquo;s air-frame groaned loudly in protest at the sudden change in direction but he paid it no heed as he readjusted his thrust vector once more and was sucked deeper into the acceleration seat.\nThe sleek ship catapulted upward out of the crag just feet ahead of the explosion of the missile against the face of the inner cliff wall. Arcing high through the Martian sky he let off the throttle and turned through a graceful pirouette before nosing down again and skimming along the ground back toward the landing strip.\n\u0026ldquo;This is the last time I work with the Turrellie\u0026rsquo;s.\u0026rdquo; He said to the empty co-pilot\u0026rsquo;s seat as he eased the ship down to a gentle landing, sending a cloud of red dust up into the air around it.\nFive minutes later he was suited up in his lightly armored pressure suit and checking the clip on his pistol. Finding the magazine full he slapped it into the weapon and slid it home in its low-slung thigh holster, then reached for his ace in the hole. The bolt caster was a relatively compact little weapon, about like the old sawed-off shotguns you saw in those ancient movies. Unlike its look-alike however, this weapon had a single barrel that was nearly as big around as his wrist. Hitting the release, the barrel dropped open at the breech with a solid click and he slid the two-pound, rocket propelled projectile home, and slapped the weapon closed again. Sliding the weapon home in the holster across the small of his back he activated his helmet and stepped into the air lock as it grew up out of his collar and sealed itself around his head with a subtle hiss.\nThe Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s air lock cycled closed again behind him as he surveyed the barren Martian landscape. Turning toward the front of the ship he could see the faint lights of the domed city of Hector in the far-off distance. Raising his arms he activated the holographic interface for his personal computer and tapped the control to dim his visor against the barely-filtered light of the far off sun.\n\u0026ldquo;An impressive landing, as usual.\u0026rdquo; The voice broke harshly across him as it crackled through his comm..\nTurning around he saw three suited figures standing behind him, all armed, but at ease. Their suites were newer models, but not armored as well as his was. If it came to blows he would have the advantage in the protection department, but they were all toting cyclic weapons in addition to their regular side arms. They had him trumped in firepower, unless he counted his ace, but that was a last resort.\nActivating his line-of-sight comm. he tried to sound friendly. \u0026ldquo;Axel. Nice to see you alive and well after our last meeting.\u0026rdquo; He hoped the sarcasm was evident in his voice, the last time they had met like this, Axel had tried to ditch the cargo on him as the law had rolled in on the scene of their exchange.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, I made out alright. I always have an escape plan at the ready.\u0026rdquo; The man smirked through the visor of his shiny new pressure suit.\n\u0026ldquo;So I noticed. And just for the record, I am only doing this as a favor to a friend. If I had my way, you\u0026rsquo;d be sucking exhaust fumes and choking on this crate of yours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Now, Mr. Torres. That\u0026rsquo;s no way to treat a business partner. Surely you understand that there are no hard feelings over that little incident. Merely business.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Business my ass. You tried to feed me to the feds Axel, and you had better believe I took it personally. Now, you want to tell me about that little missile stunt?\u0026rdquo;\nAxel grinned evilly at him through his shiny faceplate. \u0026ldquo;Just a little test to insure you still have the skills necessary to make delivery. The belt is not easily navigated under the best of circumstances.\u0026rdquo;\nVin felt his temper rising, he wanted to wipe the smug expression off Axel\u0026rsquo;s face. Briefly he considered inviting him on board the Neophyte just so they could scrape, but he\u0026rsquo;d rather be shot dead here and now than have that man on board his ship for any reason. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t tell me my business Axel, the next time you fire a friggin missile at me I am going to shove it down your damn throat. Now where\u0026rsquo;s this crate? I have a meeting with some important people that I need to get to.\u0026rdquo;\nAxel\u0026rsquo;s face turned sour instantly, one thing he obviously could not handle was an inference that he might not be important. \u0026ldquo;Now you listen here Torres\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No YOU listen.\u0026rdquo; Vin cut him off suddenly. \u0026ldquo;YOU need to get rid of this thing. No one else will touch it because they all know you are a cheating bastard. As it happens I know Lou pretty well and he asked me to pick it up as a personal favor to HIM. Now I could give a \u0026lsquo;tail about whether you live or die, in fact I\u0026rsquo;d sleep better at night if it were suddenly the latter, but Lou\u0026rsquo;s a friend of mine so I agreed to haul this for HIM. Not you. So where\u0026rsquo;s the friggin crate at?\u0026rdquo;\nAxel took half a step forward as if he was going to attack, reflexively Vin\u0026rsquo;s hand dropped to his belt, ready to draw if he needed to. The other two men standing there suddenly had their machine guns at the ready and Vin opened his hands, palms facing them and away from his weapons. He didn\u0026rsquo;t want this to turn messy, he just wanted to pick up his fare and get away from here as quickly as he could.\nFinally Axel seemed to get hold of himself and stood up straight, making a motion as though he were straightening out his lapels. The action was comical at best in his gleaming pressure suit. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just over here.\u0026rdquo;\nVin looked past the trio toward the camouflage netting on the ground behind the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity. Under the reddish-brown net was a collapsible pressure tent and a medium sized, pressurizable metal crate.\n\u0026ldquo;Great, get it on board so I can get the hell off this mud-ball.\u0026rdquo; He keyed in the security code on his computer and the loading ramp on the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s aft hull trundled open, allowing access to the large rear cargo hold.\nAs the two other men loaded the crate into the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s hold and tied it securely to the deck plates and wall, Vin watched their every movement, making sure they didn\u0026rsquo;t leave anything other than that crate on board. He had checked the tamper seals as they carried the crate past him and it showed no signs of having been opened since it was initially sealed.\n\u0026ldquo;Such interest. You think I would do anything to jeopardize my own business?\u0026rdquo; Axel asked innocently.\n\u0026ldquo;Axel, I don\u0026rsquo;t give a fark who is loading cargo onto my ship, they all get the same attention. And seeing as how you have already cut off your nose to spite your face in the \u0026lsquo;business\u0026rsquo; world, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t seem like you really have that much to loose.\u0026rdquo;\nAxel was quiet for a long moment as his men finished securing the crate and exited the ship\u0026rsquo;s cargo hold. As soon as they were clear, Vin signaled the ship to seal the hold and turned around to face Axel again.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright then. Your box is as good as delivered. I expect this to be the very last time we see one another.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why do you say such hurtful things to me Mr. Torres?\u0026rdquo; Axel responded in mock hurt.\n\u0026ldquo;Because you tried to kill me, and I don\u0026rsquo;t like you.\u0026rdquo; He paused for effect, \u0026ldquo;at all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;All in the line of doing business my friend. Now you understand that this is cargo that is not to fall into the hands of the feds. To do so would destroy your reputation.\u0026rdquo;\nVin wheeled around on Axel, his finger raised and pointing at the other man accusingly. \u0026ldquo;Hey Axel. Do you see the big xenon sign on the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s hull that says \u0026lsquo;greenhorn runner\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\nAxel looked at him questioningly for a long moment.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t frig with me Axel. DO you SEE the SIGN?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see nothing of the sort.\u0026rdquo; Axel finally responded, sounding a little harried.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s because it ISN\u0026rsquo;T THERE!\u0026rdquo; Vin half shouted into the comm..\n\u0026ldquo;Mr. Torres I wasn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shut up Axel. And get clear before I slag the lot of you. With the backwash from my engines.\u0026rdquo; Vin wheeled around and walked toward the air lock, cycling the door open as he approached it. He didn\u0026rsquo;t even look behind him to see if the trio was moving. As air cycled into the lock he used his personal computer to fire up the ship\u0026rsquo;s engines. His helmet was nearly retracted out of sight by the time he passed through the ready room, stowing his weapons quickly as he slipped through into the cockpit and strapped himself into the acceleration seat.\nTen seconds later the Neophyte was airborne and burning straight through the thin Martian atmosphere, headed out into space and away from the dusty orange ground and the two-bit gangsters there.\nAs the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity hurtled out of Mar\u0026rsquo;s local space and toward the far side of the Asteroid belt, Vin took a moment to relax, disengaging the seals on his pressure suit, he slipped the gloves off and set them on the control panel. He was half way through a good, long stretch when an alarm tore through the relative silence of the ship.\nIn a snap he brushed his gloves aside and punched up the display for the sensors that were in alarm.\n\u0026ldquo;Frig! He shouted as he keyed in a sequence of controls that cycled air into the aft cargo hold. In a flash he was barreling down the hallway toward the hold, yanking his hand gun off the rack as he passed it by and jamming it into his holster as he reached the door.\n\u0026ldquo;Friggin Axel, dumping some crap on me. I swear I am going to hunt him down and see that the feds get to have their way with him.\u0026rdquo;\nThe door hissed as it slid aside, permitting him entry into the chilly cargo hold. He slipped a portable scanner out of its charging cradle on the wall and slowly approached the mysterious crate with the device held out in front of him. The device chirped at him as he drew near the crate. Tapping a few controls, the device silenced itself and he inspected the display intently for a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;Yep, no question, that ass has slipped some sort of active fusion power supply into this damn crate. Lou said it was supposed to be inert.\u0026rdquo;\nHe was accessing his personal computer, half way through keying up a comm. link to his friend when the portable scanner chirped again. Glancing down at the device his jaw went slack. The scanner was also picking up life signs from within the crate. He raced through a couple of screens on the device and eyed it suspiciously for a moment, there was no mistake, that crate had a person inside and their oxygen was running out.\n\u0026ldquo;Crap!\u0026rdquo; He shouted at the crate. Pausing only briefly, he lunged forward and started tapping away at the control panel on the crate, trying to force it open. After what seemed like hours he finally gave up, drew his pistol and shot the panel which exploded into a spectacular array of sparks and light, but the seal on the crate remained intact. So he shot it again, then a third time for good measure. Finally the thing seemed to suffer a change of heart and the seal cracked open with a hiss.\nOffering the crate a swift kick, the side fell open and the body of a young woman tumbled out onto the deck of the cargo hold.\n"

	"content": "Riana dropped to the ground so quickly that her long platinum hair hung in the air for an instant allowing the razor sharp blade to shear off several inches of her thick tresses before gravity could pull them out of the way. She threw her weight to the right, twisting her svelte frame around as she rolled away from the heavy boot that was now moving swiftly toward her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Kat! Now!\u0026rdquo; She hollered as she rolled clear of the orc.\nStepping out from behind the large tree she had been hiding behind, Katrina\u0026rsquo;s long, tapered elven ears swept back in concentration as she uttered the spell and a gout of flames lanced from her extended hand and thrust into the orc\u0026rsquo;s chest.\nThe orc yelped in pain, dropping its weapon to the ground and beating furiously at its chest to try and squelch the flames.\nRiana threw her leg out and, pivoting on her other foot, swung herself around in an arc, kicking her outstretched leg into the back of the orc\u0026rsquo;s legs, driving the creature to the ground with a solid thump. As it landed on it\u0026rsquo;s back, Riana kipped up to her feet and turned around to face the creature with a smirk on her lips. Chanting an incantation and pointing at the creature as a bolt of lightning arced from her finger to the orc, causing it to convulse wildly as muscle spasms wracked its body and cooked its tissues.\nKatrina made her way over to Riana\u0026rsquo;s side and the twins stood and looked down on the dead orc with a note of satisfaction. Drawing her dwarven dagger, Riana knelt down next to the corpse and unceremoniously sliced off it\u0026rsquo;s left ear. Wiping the blade of her dagger on its fur-lined tunic, she re-sheathed the weapon and stuffed the ear into a ratty leather sack hanging from her belt.\n\u0026ldquo;Does he have any coin on him?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked cheerfully.\nRiana sifted through the orc\u0026rsquo;s belt pouches until she found a few copper disks which she passed to her sister. \u0026ldquo;Not much. They aren\u0026rsquo;t really even worth going after.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s all worth it.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said simply as she deposited the coins in her own coin purse, fat with the copper disks. \u0026ldquo;They all add up Ree.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, whatever.\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she stood up from the orc and uttered an incantation that caused the orc\u0026rsquo;s body to burst into flames. \u0026ldquo;Would be nice if we knew a spell that could do this to a live orc.\u0026rdquo; She said half to herself.\n\u0026ldquo;That would make it tough to collect their ears for the guard.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana ran her hands through her long, platinum tresses, playing with the severed ends and sighing as she inspected the difference in length from one side of her head to the other. Her long, tapered ears cocked back in disgust as she \u0026lsquo;tsked\u0026rsquo; and let the ends drop back against her thick magus robes. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to cut my hair.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Serves you right, getting that close to the thing.\u0026rdquo; Katrina admonished her.\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t understand Kat, I LIKE being that close to the fight. I think I am going to get a sword.\u0026rdquo; Riana inspected the handle of her dagger as she spoke, reminiscing about their encounter with goblins in the city\u0026rsquo;s aqueducts that had resulted in the awarding of the blade.\nKatrina made a sour face at her sister as she deposited her coin purse in her belt pouch. \u0026ldquo;Whatever works for you Ree, but it just seems so\u0026hellip; barbaric\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She drew a finger across her temple, securing a few stray locks of hair behind her ear.\n\u0026ldquo;I wonder how much a good sword costs\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana mumbled under her breath as she stood up and moved toward her sister. Looking toward Katrina she half smiled as she raised her voice to a more conversational level, \u0026ldquo;So, where to now?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina removed a small, worn piece of parchment from a fold in her robe and unrolled it. Inspecting the document for\u0026nbsp; a moment, she looked up at the surrounding trees repeatedly as if trying to get her bearings. Finally she pointed roughly North and said, \u0026ldquo;It looks as though their camp is in this direction, that\u0026rsquo;s where we should probably start our search.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked off in\u0026nbsp; the direction her sister was pointing, her violet eyes focusing on the stand of trees that was the most likely location for a clan of orcs to conceal themselves in. \u0026ldquo;Probably in those trees somewhere.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina nodded her agreement as the twins set off in unison, taking long strides with their slender, athletic legs. As they fell into stride, Katrina pulled her spell book from her robes and began leafing through its thick, parchment pages absently.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to trip over something and kill yourself, you know that right?\u0026rdquo; Riana poked at Katrina.\n\u0026ldquo;Not likely. I have my big sister to watch out for me.\u0026rdquo; katrina replied absently as she flipped another page with a raised eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;What do you mean big? I\u0026rsquo;m only like\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana counted off a couple of fingers and quirked her brow, \u0026ldquo;two minutes older than you!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said curtly, \u0026ldquo;At any rate, if I trip and hurt myself\u0026nbsp; mom will hold you just as accountable as me for it. So I have every confidence that you will look after me. Besides, it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t hurt you to re-memorize some spells either. You must have used up half your lot by now.\u0026rdquo; She continued flipping the pages of the thick tome with interest as she spoke.\nRiana turned and cast her sister a disparaging look before returning her gaze to the ground ahead of them. \u0026ldquo;In point of fact, I still have yet to use a single one today. You\u0026rsquo;ve been doing all of the spell casting up to this point.\u0026rdquo;\nWithout missing a beat Katrina replied, \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I THOUGHT I was having to work a little hard today. Now that I know I have been picking up your slack it makes more sense.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana ignored her sister\u0026rsquo;s words as they moved closer to the stand of trees that they thought contained the orcs in question. \u0026ldquo;So, these orcs made off with the farmer\u0026rsquo;s daughter? What do you think they are doing with some little human girl?\n\u0026ldquo;Not sure. Maybe they mean to eat her or force her to smelt iron ore for their weapons or something. At any rate, she isn\u0026rsquo;t \u0026lsquo;little\u0026rsquo; per se, she is sixteen years old.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Kat, we\u0026rsquo;re nearly eighteen years old and everyone still calls us younglings. How could a seventeen year old not be \u0026lsquo;little\u0026rsquo;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because she\u0026rsquo;s human Ree. She\u0026rsquo;s lived nearly a third of her life already. Things work a little differently in their culture.\u0026rdquo; Katrina finally snapped her spell book shut and slipped it back into the fold in her robes she had retrieved it from earlier.\nRiana gaped at her, marveling at how she could find the hidden pocket again and again without any effort at all. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s another thing. These robes have got to go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Go where?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked absently as she focused her golden eyes on the approaching trees, her ears perked up and focused on the same destination.\n\u0026ldquo;Away.\u0026rdquo; Riana said half-heartedly. \u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t hardly move in them, and once I DO get going the hem and sleeves are always swishing about, throwing off my balance.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina was still only half listening to her sister as they moved steadily toward the trees, now looming large in front of them. \u0026ldquo;You should just tell mom that you don\u0026rsquo;t want to study at the academy any longer.\u0026rdquo; She was still scrutinizing the trees as she spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not that I don\u0026rsquo;t want to stop studying there. I just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She struggled to find the words but they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t come. \u0026ldquo;Something isn\u0026rsquo;t quite right about the way they do things\u0026hellip; for me at least.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well I still think you should just tell mom. I am sure she will be receptive to whatever you have to say. She IS your mother after all.\u0026rdquo; She stopped moving as she finished the statement, throwing her arm out and stopping Riana abruptly as well.\n\u0026ldquo;What the he\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Shhhhh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina hissed, pressing her finger to her lips as she crouched down low and peered intently into the trees that were now no more than twenty feet from them.\nRiana crouched down next to her and peered into the trees as well, searching for any sign of what had spooked her sister. Finally she saw it, something moving so slowly that it took a few long moments to make sure that it really was in motion. It was about the size of a human man, bent down double and creeping along the forest floor on all fours.\n\u0026ldquo;You see it?\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Katrina whispered back. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the plan?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Snare it?\u0026rdquo; Riana offered.\n\u0026ldquo;If it is an orc it will start screaming for help, I don\u0026rsquo;t think we are equipped to handle a horde of them.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well then attacking it is certainly out of the question. How about we invite it to tea, we could slip it a poisoned draught.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied sarcastically.\n\u0026ldquo;Not necessarily out of the question.\u0026rdquo; Katrina ignored the comment. \u0026ldquo;I can stun it, then you can put some of your new skills to the test, take it down quietly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are we sure it\u0026rsquo;s an orc? Could be some big lizard or something\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you afraid to go over there and stab it?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Riana balked at her sisters accusation, almost letting her voice get away from her as she half stood up with her hand on her dagger.\n\u0026ldquo;Calm down Ree. It\u0026rsquo;s an orc, just listen to it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine. You stun it. I\u0026rsquo;ll go\u0026hellip; take care of it\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; Riana slipped her dagger out of its sheath and uttered an invisibility incantation, vanishing from sight instantly as the last syllable was uttered.\nKatrina grinned widely as she watched her sister vanish. She knew Riana wanted more than the spells they taught at the academy, that was why she had been sneaking out of her counter-spell classes in order to sneak out of the academy and study martial arts and weapons with an instructor that lived in the village near the academy. She just wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if she was quite prepared for the reality of the path she was on the verge of choosing. She herself had had to stab something once. A goblin that had invaded their home in Rathalon not too long ago. She had done it to save Riana from what would have been a fatal blow to the head. There had been no question of right or wrong, no moral dilemma. But still, she had stabbed it with her own hands on her own knife, and killed it in the same action.\nShe knew that it was technically no different than killing something with a lightning bolt, or a fire ball. But somehow doing it by physical means made the act so much more poignant, more visceral, more\u0026hellip; she searched for the word to describe it, when it hit her she knew instantly why she had had trouble finding it. It felt like murder. It lacked that detachment that the range of a good spell allowed her. She hoped with all her heart that Riana was prepared to deal with that. And she knew they were both about to find out. Calmly she focused her mind on the form of the orc, having waited long enough for Riana to get near the thing, she focused her mind on the flow of magic and uttered the stunning incantation.\nThe orc suddenly stood up as though it had been yanked roughly by its jerkin. It\u0026rsquo;s pale green skin still blending in with the foliage around it, but the creature was obviously not aware of what was going on as it stared off into the open field outside its protective cover, its beady red eyes as blank as the victim of a master hypnotist.\nSuddenly Riana\u0026rsquo;s lithe form appeared in front of the creature, her dagger held at the ready in her right hand, and her left hand guarding her face in case the beast tried to attack her. She hesitated for a moment, considering the magnitude of what she was about to do. True she had slashed at things with her knife. She had even callously sliced off dead orc\u0026rsquo;s ears in order to turn them in for the bounty with the Rathalon guard, but she still had yet to actually kill anything with a weapon such as this. She had been hiding behind her sister. Pretending that it would not be a major event for her. But here she was, standing in front of her target, a human life hanging in the balance The law was on her side, she had every reason in the world to strike the creature down and yet she hesitated.\nFinally the decision was made for her as the orc\u0026rsquo;s eyes began to clear. Slowly it began to become aware of its surroundings and when it saw her its eyes widened with rage and its mouth began to open, air drawing into its lungs as it prepared to bellow some fierce war cry to call aid from its friends.\nRiana acted instantly lunging forward with all the strength and speed she could muster, she slipped the thin blade of the dagger through the orc\u0026rsquo;s leather jerkin, between two if its ribs and drove the blade to the hilt in its lung. Her vision blurred and her world went silent as the training took over. She stepped into the orc\u0026rsquo;s stance, placing her right foot behind its right and drove her right hand upward into its chin. When the orc recoiled from the blow to its chin, it made as if to stagger backward but tripped over her leg and fell ungracefully on its back, choking and gasping for air with a sick gurgle as blood filled its lungs.\nRiana looked down on the orc as it gasped and sputtered, reaching up to her with both arms as if she were some angel that had come to whisk it away to the afterlife. Suddenly the gravity of the situation slammed in on her mind and she shuddered. Dropping to her knees next to the dying orc she wrapped her arms around herself and squeezed as she looked at the orc, its red eyes filled with panic.\n\u0026ldquo;You have to finish it Riana. Stop its suffering.\u0026rdquo; Katrina spoke quietly as she moved up to them and looked down on the orc and her sister.\nTentatively, Riana reached out and wrapped her hand around the handle of her dagger and gave it a small tug. When the blade didn\u0026rsquo;t budge she looked up at her sister questioningly.\n\u0026ldquo;Pull it out.\u0026rdquo; Was all Katrina said.\nLooking back to the orc, Riana wrapped her other hand around the first and yanked the dagger out of the orc\u0026rsquo;s chest along with a spray of blood. She stared at the scarlet liquid as it pooled on the tip of the blade and then dripped off.\n\u0026ldquo;Now finish him Riana. Stop him suffering.\u0026rdquo;\nSlowly Riana moved the slender blade to the orc\u0026rsquo;s throat and then closed her eyes as she pressed down and drew the blade across its skin. It was over in seconds after that.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be like that.\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she looked at the blood on her hands doubtfully.\n\u0026ldquo;When lives are on the line, we have to do what we have to do. It was him or you Riana. Just like with the goblin.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked up at Katrina, her violet eyes clouding. \u0026ldquo;Kat, I had no idea. I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina knelt down next to Riana and wrapped an arm around her sister\u0026rsquo;s shoulders. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s alright Riana. I learned something that day. I learned that people are put in these situations every single day. Situations where life and death are decided and that all we can do is fight for what we believe to be right, and never succumb to the killing spirit.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked up at her sister, eyes wet with tears. \u0026ldquo;What is the killing spirit?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Some people, some times, will kill because they can. Not because they have to. That is the killing spirit. This is what it means to be a warrior Riana. I know you will be alright, and I know you will be great fighter. This is just a small hurdle, but always keep it in the back of your head that one day you will have to choose. You will have to make the decision as to whether someone else lives or dies by your hand, someone who may not need to die. And while I have no doubt in my mind that you will always walk the path of good, that path sometimes becomes blurred. The killing spirit will cloud your mind and dull your senses. You must learn to control it. You must learn to make the correct decision.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked up at her sister\u0026rsquo;s face as she wiped a tear from her eye. She was surprised to see Katrina\u0026rsquo;s eyes glazed over and staring off into space as she spoke. \u0026ldquo;Kat?\u0026rdquo; She sniffled with concern.\nKatrina turned her head and looked down at Riana, her expression still vacant, but she smiled comfortingly and gently ran her hand down the side of Riana\u0026rsquo;s face like their mother did when she was comforting them. \u0026ldquo;I love you Riana. I will always love you.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana jerked herself out of Katrina\u0026rsquo;s arms, picking herself up suddenly and getting her feet under her, she spun around a looked at Katrina. \u0026ldquo;Kat, what\u0026rsquo;s going on? Are you ok?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina\u0026nbsp; shook her head, almost violently as if she was trying to clear it, then looked up at Riana searchingly, her eyes sharp and clear now. \u0026ldquo;Ree? What happened?\u0026rdquo; She looked around herself, at the orc, and then back up at her sister. \u0026ldquo;How did I get over here? I was back there, casting the stun spell one moment, then\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She cast her eyes around again, looking for some explanation.\nRiana looked at her sister somewhat fearfully. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know Kat, you were talking about some kind of\u0026nbsp; spirit and calling me Riana. It was like you were someone else entirely. Are you ok?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina shook her head again and looked at her hands, fingers spread wide as though she was expecting to see someone else\u0026rsquo;s hands there. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know\u0026hellip; I think so\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you ok to go on?\u0026rdquo; Riana asked tentatively.\nKatrina looked back up at her sister, her ears perking up a bit, \u0026ldquo;Yeah. Let\u0026rsquo;s get this done and then we can think about it.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana offered her sister a comforting look before retrieving her dagger and turning to face into the stand of trees. \u0026ldquo;Ok then. Let\u0026rsquo;s get on with it.\u0026rdquo;\nTogether they forged ahead into the forest, dodging the occasional branch or tree root while trying to keep their noise down. They knew the place was home to a clan of orcs, not only because of the fact that they had just encountered one, but also because the human that had offered to pay them to rescue his daughter from the orcs had said that he had managed to track the beasts as far as these trees before he had lost his nerve to continue and decided to hire some adventurers to assist him with his issue.\nThe girls had quickly jumped at the chance to be of assistance, never even asking what he would be offering as compensation. Their family, while not wealthy, was not hurting for money. They lived in one of the more affluent areas of the capital city of Rathalon and their mother managed to keep them from wanting much, either by providing, or by gently pointing out the difference between needing and wanting (sometimes with a very stern scolding, accompanied by fire and brimstone for effect).\nThey enjoyed doing odd jobs for people around the city more to be of assistance than to scrape together any form of money, although the money they did make was always put to good use in the local clothing and trinket shops.\nBut in this instance the need of the simple farmer was too much to ignore. The money, or whatever he offered them, was of little import to them. Their primary concern from the beginning had been the safety of the young girl, now in the hands of the beastly orcs that had dragged her into this forest.\nNot twenty minutes later they began to hear the signs of a camp of some sort up ahead. They slowed their pace in order to keep from making too much noise and crept through the underbrush at a snail\u0026rsquo;s pace until they could see the simple camp through the cover of the trees.\nIn a large clearing ahead of them the orcs had erected a dozen or so tents, some of them shored up around the base with low rock walls indicating that they had been here long enough to start building more permanent structures. There were a few rickety wooden towers standing at odd intervals around the perimeter and throughout the tiny town, each tower bearing a medium sized orc with a bow and arrows, standing constant vigil against encroachers from outside.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the plan?\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered in a whisper so quiet that only Katrina\u0026rsquo;s keen elven hearing could detect it at even their close range.\n\u0026ldquo;Not sure. Where do you think they might have taken her?\u0026rdquo; Katrina whispered back in similar fashion.\nTogether they scrutinized each and every visible structure in the camp. Finally their eyes settled on a small tent at nearly the same instant. It was barely larger than a one room cabin, with a low wall of stones built up around its perimeter and a smallish orc standing in front of the entrance flap with a rusty axe of some kind held at the ready in his hand.\n\u0026ldquo;There.\u0026ldquo;They said at once.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s the only guarded tent.\u0026rdquo; Katrina followed up.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, but how do we get in there?\u0026rdquo; Riana wondered quietly as she scrutinized the tent. It was close to the edge of the clearing, but far enough in that there was at minimum, one other tent they would have to pass in order to get to it, but its entrance was facing into the center of the settlement, meaning they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be able to stay on the forest side of the tent and still gain entrance.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you see any mages or shaman in there?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked as she went over the clearing again, searching for signs of magic users.\nRiana swept her eyes over the tents one more time, finally responding, \u0026ldquo;No. Do you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; Katrina replied as she looked back at her sister. \u0026ldquo;Which means it is unlikely that any of them can see the invisible.\u0026rdquo; She grinned slightly.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh!\u0026rdquo; Riana quietly exclaimed. She had completely forgotten about the invisibility enchantment they had been taught the week at the academy. Quietly she sat down and withdrew her spell book from her pouch and gently unwrapped it from the soft leather she kept it in. GEntly she laid the pristine book in her lap on top of the leather cover and began silently leafing though the immaculate pages of perfectly formed letters.\nKatrina sighed slightly as she sat down next to her sister and slipped her own, extremely well used spell book out of her robes and into her own lap. By contrast, her book bore smashed corners and warped pages of thick parchment that were smudged with hand prints, set forever in various magical, indelible inks. Her own hand writing, while easily legible, was anything but pristine. It bore the mark of one who wrote for a living, keeping it legible but using the absolute minimum number of pen strokes to make the letters.\nA moment later they were creeping through the trees at the edge of the clearing, hand-in-hand, heading toward the guarded tent with baited breath. As they circumnavigated the settlement, they stopped abruptly on numerous occasions, thinking they had been seen by a sentry or passing orc, only to be completely ignored as the creature continued on its way calmly. Finally they slipped between the guards as a sudden change in the direction of the breeze caused the flap of the tent to open briefly.\nOnce inside the tent they immediately saw their quarry. On a bed of furs and pillows lay a striking, blond, human woman, her eyes closed and features relaxed serenely in sleep. Silently the twins crept forward until they were sure they were alone in the tent, then dismissed their invisibility enchantments with a gesture.\n\u0026ldquo;Told you it would work.\u0026rdquo; Katrina whispered in Riana\u0026rsquo;s ear with a proud smile on her face.\n\u0026ldquo;I never said it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered back indignantly, then gestured toward the sleeping girl. \u0026ldquo;Should we wake her?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina looked at the woman as well then nodded slightly. \u0026ldquo;Our invisibility won\u0026rsquo;t work on other people yet, so we\u0026rsquo;ll have to do something with her. We should have picked up a portal ring before we left Rathalon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That would have been entirely too sensible.\u0026rdquo; Riana made a sour face as she glanced around the small space for inspiration. \u0026ldquo;I say we just cut a hole in the back of the tent and make a run for it. Straight to the trees. If we can keep it quiet we may make it without even being spotted.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina scowled. \u0026ldquo;That is a pretty big if. And it won\u0026rsquo;t be just us we have to keep track of.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I know. I am open to suggestions if you have any.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina made as if to reply, going so far as to raise her finger in the air and open her mouth before being cut off by a strange voice that, although it was a whisper, seemed like a harsh shout in the quiet space of the tent.\n\u0026ldquo;Who are you?\u0026rdquo;\nThe twins both swiveled their heads around slowly to look at the girl on the bed, looking at them with her soft, blue eyes. She was still laying in the same position, inspecting them both with quiet, unassuming eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Riana and Katrina Thorindal.\u0026rdquo; Katrina replied quietly.\n\u0026ldquo;Your father sent us here to rescue you.\u0026rdquo; Riana finished.\nSuddenly the girl\u0026rsquo;s face soured and she pulled the heavy furs she was laying under up to her ears and gripped them tightly from beneath. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going anywhere! He wants to stop me from being with Gunthil!\u0026rdquo;\nThe twins looked to one another for a moment, ears splaying out in confusion, before they turned back to the girl on the bed, staring at the top of her head, which was the only portion of her still visible beneath the mountain of furs.\n\u0026ldquo;Who is Gunthil?\u0026rdquo; They asked in unison.\n\u0026ldquo;Gunthil is the most incredible man I have ever met! He is big and strong, and sensitive, and caring, and he loves me!\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp; She nearly sat up as she whispered harshly at them, then suddenly flopped back down on the bed and curled up under the pile of furs again when she realized she had moved.\n\u0026ldquo;And Gunthil is\u0026hellip; around here somewhere?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked doubtfully, looking around the tent.\n\u0026ldquo;Dispatching orcs maybe?\u0026rdquo; Riana shrugged.\nSuddenly an indignant squeak issued forth from the pile of furs as the girl sat bolt upright and seemed to barely refrain herself from lunging at Riana bodily. \u0026ldquo;How DARE you?!\u0026rdquo; She shouted.\nThe ruckus instantly caused a commotion outside the tent as the orc guards snapped to attention and wheeled around toward the flap that was their only protection from the horde outside the tent.\n\u0026ldquo;Crap! We\u0026rsquo;ve been ratted out here!\u0026rdquo; Riana cursed under her breath.\nKatrina spun around toward the door and called out an incantation that caused a large mound of earth to rise up in front of the flap keeping the orcs from coming through the flimsy door. \u0026ldquo;That ought to hold them for about\u0026hellip; three seconds.\u0026rdquo; She said sarcastically.\n\u0026ldquo;Then we need to be gone in two.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied. \u0026ldquo;You. Let\u0026rsquo;s go.\u0026rdquo; She said to the blond girl as she drew her dagger and made her way to the back of the tent.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not going with you! I\u0026rsquo;m staying here!\u0026rdquo; The girl shouted at them. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t make me go!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s where you\u0026rsquo;re wrong.\u0026rdquo; Riana hissed as she wheeled around and struck the girl in the side of the head with the butt of her dagger. The blow landed true and knocked her out instantly, her body slumping to the bed in a heap.\n\u0026ldquo;Great. Now we have to carry her.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said sarcastically as she watched the girl crumple.\n\u0026ldquo;Get the tent open!\u0026rdquo; Riana admonished her as she sheathed her dagger and roughly picked up the girl across her shoulders.\nKatrina dove to the back of the tent with her own dagger drawn and quickly sliced a large hole in the thick fabric. As soon as it fell open she stuck her head through to check the area and, finding it clear, slipped through with Riana hot on her heels.\nThe pair ran flat-out until their muscles felt as if they were about to burst into flames. It was nearly a full minute before the sounds of pursuit rang out behind them, and even then it seemed to be going in no particular direction, but they didn\u0026rsquo;t stop their mad dash for the open space of the farm lands surrounding Rathalon until they were half way through a field of corn stalks taller than they were.\nFinally they tumbled to the ground amidst the corn stalks. Laying in a heap and panting as quietly as they could.\nThe sound of something approaching recklessly through the corn stalks brought them around again in just enough time to draw their daggers and stand up, back to back in preparation for battle. When the farmer burst through the screen of corn surrounding them and suddenly filled the tiny clearing to overflowing, Riana almost slashed viciously across his chest with her narrow blade before she realized who he was.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh gods! You found her! Oh thank you!\u0026rdquo; He was on his knees cradling the blond girl to his chest as he blubbered. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think you would be able to steal her away from those brutes, but you did it! You did get her away! Oh thank you so much!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Riana began.\n\u0026ldquo;About that.\u0026rdquo; Katrina continued.\nThe man looked up at them as they spoke. The look on his face suggested he might know what they were about to say.\n\u0026ldquo;She didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to want to leave.\u0026rdquo; They both said in unison.\n\u0026ldquo;I was afraid of that.\u0026rdquo; He replied as he hugged her form to him more tightly. Finally she began to rouse from her forcibly induced unconscious state. \u0026ldquo;That beast has turned her mind against me. He has brainwashed her into thinking he loves her.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He DOES love me daddy. It isn\u0026rsquo;t a trick.\u0026rdquo; She said weakly as she began to realize what was going on around her.\n\u0026ldquo;No honey. He wants you for something. But it isn\u0026rsquo;t love. I\u0026rsquo;ve never heard of an orc loving a human, not ever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But he told me he loves me daddy. He took me to his home and introduced me to his family. They all welcomed me with open arms and gave me my own tent with a fluffy, soft bed and warm blankets. They get me whatever I want to eat and take good care of me there.\u0026rdquo;\nThe twins stood there and stared at the girl with their golden and violet eyes wide, ears spread out in disbelief.\n\u0026ldquo;Whelp, that\u0026rsquo;s a new one on me\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, never heard that one before.\u0026rdquo; Riana echoed.\nJust then a large, green-skinned, tusk-toothed creature stepped tentatively into the ever-shrinking clearing in the corn stalks. His huge chest almost squishing the twins up against the well-muscled farmer on their other side. He narrowed his glossy red eyes at the assembled group and then looked down at the young girl who\u0026rsquo;s face began to glow brightly at the sight of him.\nThe farmer stood bolt upright, pushing out his chest toward the orc and looking around for an army that he hoped would suddenly appear to assist him. Finding himself army-less, he settled for a stern glare at the creature instead.\n\u0026ldquo;Gunthil!\u0026rdquo; The girl exclaimed, scrambling to her feet and forcing them all to suck in their chests and stomachs to make space for another standing body. Her father looked somewhat shriveled then, having lost his one good posture for intimidating the orc.\n\u0026ldquo;I come for my Galatea.\u0026rdquo; The orc said in broken common tongue.\n\u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t have her!\u0026rdquo; The farmer said resolutely, his eyes betraying his fear and defeat to anyone who cared to look.\n\u0026ldquo;Daddy, I want to go with him!\u0026rdquo; Galatea stomped her foot as she spoke, leveling an icy glare at her father.\n\u0026ldquo;I forbid it!\u0026rdquo; He shouted back at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Gunthil love Galatea.\u0026rdquo; The orc interjected simply.\n\u0026ldquo;And I\u0026rsquo;m old enough to make my own decision!\u0026rdquo; Galatea added with a triumphant nod of her head, arms folded across her chest.\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t have it! I love you too much to loose you to those creatures!\u0026rdquo; The farmer protested weakly.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my choice daddy. Gunthil and I are in love and you can\u0026rsquo;t stop that!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well I don\u0026rsquo;t approve one bit!\u0026rdquo;\nThe twins simply looked back and forth between each party as they spoke in turn, their eyes roving around the scene as if they were watching some horrific comedy unfolding on stage, unable to cope with the contents, yet unable to avert their eyes.\nThe farmer stared at his daughter, unable to come up with the words that would convince her of the danger she was willingly walking into. Or maybe she did know and was just unwilling to admit that she might actually be at risk in some way. He sighed heavily as his shoulders drooped in defeat.\nGalatea grinned with joy at the action and began hopping from foot to foot with excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;Um\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana interrupted the scene with a raised finger.\n\u0026ldquo;Can we, maybe\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina added.\n\u0026ldquo;We DID bring her to you, as per our arrangement\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana said tentatively.\n\u0026ldquo;And we\u0026rsquo;d like to conclude our business before this gets all weepy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina continued.\n\u0026ldquo;Or tragic\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana said under her breath.\n\u0026ldquo;Or whatever.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said a little louder to cover up her sister\u0026rsquo;s negative response.\nThe trio stared at them blankly for a long moment before the farmer dumbly slipped a small pouch out of his pocket and handed it to Riana, who instantly slipped it into a fold in her robes and bowed slightly to the man.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you. And now if I might say so, you should all sit down and talk this out. If you are going to be family, you should learn to talk to one another. Sooner rather than later too, a lot of damage can be done by letting this sort of thing just fester.\nKatrina looked at her sister with a strange quirk to her eyebrow before smiling at the others in the clearing and offering a shallow curtsey to them. \u0026ldquo;Aye, thank you, and she is right. Although I am not sure where she got that from. You all should talk this out.\u0026rdquo;\nThe farmer looked at his daughter who was now hugging the orc tightly, her cheek pressed into his chest and his arms wrapped around her shoulders protectively.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; the farmer said quietly. \u0026ldquo;Would you be willing to\u0026hellip; come to my home\u0026hellip; and talk?\u0026rdquo; He asked sheepishly of the orc.\nGunthil nodded slightly and the trio made their way out of the clearing, heading toward the farm house.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, that was odd\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina sighed as soon as they were out of ear-shot.\n\u0026ldquo;No doubt.\u0026rdquo; Riana agreed as she pulled the small pouch out of her robes and upended it into her open palm. A tiny shower of silver coins rolled out into her hand and she quickly divided them into two piles and handed half to her sister who slipped them into her own coin purse.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you think they\u0026rsquo;ll be ok?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked as she tied her coin purse closed.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; Riana said flatly as she did the same. \u0026ldquo;I think we should tell the guards to check that farm house out on our way back into the city.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina tossed a worried look over her shoulder as they moved off through the corn in the opposite direction the trio had taken.\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "The warm afternoon air streamed through Riana\u0026rsquo;s dark purple hair as she moved swiftly across the Plain of Serenity. Her hair had grown quite a bit in the months that she had been searching. It now fell nearly to her waist in a ragged pony tail, a contrast to the neat arrangement that used to hold her shoulder-length locks. Her long elven ears were perked up, listening for any signs of danger as her violet eyes scanned the horizon with an intense scrutiny. She quickly covered the distance to what she hoped would at last be her final destination.\nFine features reflected her time in the wilds of Kalijor, being wind lashed as she roamed from place to place searching, always searching. The soft black leather top and breechcloth, enchanted to ease friction against her newly tattooed skin so long ago, looked as if she had only purchased them yesterday. The mystical tattoos themselves had long since healed, ceasing to be a constant source of discomfort to her, although her skin was still slightly more sensitive than it used to be. In the months of her searching, many of the mystical markings that had previously been faded and dulled due to her lack of power and skill, had since come into sharp focus, reflecting her strengthening will and skills.\nXanthe sped along the grassy plain with a smooth, constant gait that far outstripped the pace of even the strongest horses in the realm. His sinewy, scaled body looked like shimmering white crystals flowing in the daylight as his four powerful legs propelled them along close to the ground. His long neck and tail swayed hypnotically as he moved, his long horns hugging his neck as they arced gracefully away from his serene dragon-like face.\nTogether they had been searching Kalijor for more than six months for any sign, any indication of where her sister had been taken. Katrina had gone to give Malice the crystal key in Kalijor, while Riana was to retrieve Solidarity Online\u0026rsquo;s prototype processor from the mercenary, Gregory Shantal, at the same time on Mars Station. Both meetings had turned out to be traps. Riana had barely escaped from her exchange with her life, and had seen a vision of her sister being beat, nearly to death, by Malice in Rathalon. She was forced to watch helplessly as, after the beating, Katrina had been dragged into a magical portal and vanished. So Riana had dedicated herself to finding her sister, wherever she was, and freeing her of whatever bonds were keeping her in peril. In the meantime, her body remained in its game pod on the Tyconderoga, with IV\u0026rsquo;s feeding her body essential nutrients and piezoelectric stimulators working to keep her idle muscles from deteriorating.\nThe search had begun in the Crossed Swords tavern in Rathalon, the unofficial capital city of Kalijor. Despite the fact that she had seen many of the patrons there in a vision, none of them had been forthcoming with any information. They all remembered the fight, but none of them had any idea where the pair had vanished to or how. They had simply disappeared into thin air.\nGornin, at the Cohai Observatory, had not been of much use either. The mysterious old troll had only said that there were many places in Kalijor that were beyond the reach of the gods. These places were accessible only to those who knew how to get to them, and almost anyone who knew such things, would never reveal their secrets. At least, not without some hefty persuasion.\nNow she was trying to track down any tale of places so difficult to find and enter that no one knew anyone who had actually been there. It had been a daunting task when she first began six months ago, and was no less so now, although she had been able to put to rest several rumors. One such rumor had suggested that there was an old hollow tree in the vast Forest of Brume, and if one rapped on its gnarly outer surface in such a way, a portal would open to a secret dungeon beneath it. After researching every conceivable approach to the tree and combing through the forest for a month, following each set of instructions to the letter, she had never encountered such a hollow tree.\nAnother rumor suggested that there was a secret chamber beneath the Burning Expanse that could be accessed by the wielder of the enigmatic Master Sword. The Master Sword was a weapon of such beauty that it enchanted those that laid eyes on it, forcing them to stand and stare at its magnificence. Of course no one knew anything about how or where to acquire the sword. However, the records in the Magic Academy\u0026rsquo;s extensive library seemed to support that the weapon existed, or at least had existed at some point in the past. That trail ran cold there though, with no leads as to where the sword might be.\nCurrently, she was chasing down a rumor about an ancient tower that sat in the middle of The Bramble. The story went that the defender of the tower could allow access to a secret chamber if he was bested in combat. This particular tale required a person to acquire the key to the tower from the leader of a tribe of goblins inhabiting The Bramble. So, she and Xanthe had ridden hard through the night, having left Rathalon at first light the day before. They had just sighted the edge of The Bramble, a tangled and gnarly forest with thin, spindly trees that seemed to grow in every direction but skyward. The entire forest, hundreds of acres in size, seemed more like a giant shrub or bush than an actual forest. Long since overrun by the strange, twisted trees that grew from nowhere with the speed and voracity of a bed of thistles, it had once been the site of a large human city.\nXanthe\u0026rsquo;s powerful strides drew them toward the dark spot on the horizon. From her perch on his back, Riana spied a prone form on the ground ahead of them. It was small, faintly green, and partially hidden among the knee high grass. Drawing the great half-dragon to a halt, she slid off his back and patted him reassuringly on the neck as she cautiously stepped towards the body to investigate.\nTentatively, she prodded the diminutive form with her booted toe. When it failed to respond, she rolled it over onto its back so she could see it more clearly. The creature would have been about three feet tall had it been standing upright. The greenish tint to its skin faded into a pale yellow color on its stomach and the insides of its arms and legs. Its head was a little too large for its body and bore a long, crooked nose beneath sharp, protruding eyebrow ridges. Solid black eyes stared up at the sky lifelessly and its clawed hands still clutched at a short bow and a handful of arrows. Apparently it had never even managed to get one of the projectiles knocked before its life was cut short.\nFour long, deep gashes across the creature\u0026rsquo;s chest, running from its left shoulder down to its right hip were clearly the cause of the creature\u0026rsquo;s demise.\n\u0026ldquo;Goblin.\u0026rdquo; Riana said aloud, causing Xanthe to look down at her curiously, blinking his large blue eyes. \u0026ldquo;Dead, and without much of a fight. Someone caught it completely by surprise.\u0026rdquo;\nPassing several more dead goblins as they continued toward The Bramble, Riana realized that they were not the only ones heading into the thicket. The only question she had was, were these \u0026lsquo;others\u0026rsquo; going to be a problem for her?\nAs they drew even with the edge of the \u0026lsquo;trees\u0026rsquo;, they could hear the faint sounds of combat emanating from within the forest. The occasional clash of metal on metal and the high pitched squeals and grunts of goblins. Looking up and down the tree line, Riana could see no way for Xanthe to get into the forest with her, so she dismounted and patted him affectionately on the neck. \u0026ldquo;Looks like you\u0026rsquo;ll have to stay here and cover our retreat friend.\u0026rdquo;\nXanthe bowed his head in understanding and then pushed her towards the trees with his nose, urging her on. He seemed as anxious to find Katrina as Riana was.\nDrawing Elkorine with her right hand, she examined the short sword as the light played off of its matte grey finish, the elven runes on its blade soaking up the light. A memory of that morning in the cellar of the Cohai Observatory as Gornin and Dorin had given her and Katrina the magical weapons played through her mind. Master Gornin had told her that the the magical sword had been a part of every major event in Kalijor\u0026rsquo;s known history, and that it would serve her well for as long as she needed it. She felt a sudden pang of guilt for not being there with her sister in order to defend her against Malice. She had protested Xavier\u0026rsquo;s chosen course at some great length, but in the end, he had forced the issue, and they had separated. Shaking the memories off with a shudder, she pressed into the thickly matted trees of The Bramble, heading toward the sounds of conflict.\nThe trees grew close together, at extreme and strange angles to one another, creating a thickly woven mass of branches and trunks that made it difficult to navigate. Pressing through the mass as quickly as she could, Riana felt the brambles scratching her skin and grabbing at her clothes. Catching her foot in a protruding root, she fell, bruising her knees and shins. By the time she got close enough to see what was causing the noise, she had scratches and bruises from head to toe thanks to her hasty journey through the impossible tangle.\nIn a large clearing, several crumbling buildings\u0026mdash;the remains of the former human city\u0026mdash;offered a dozen or so goblins an easy advantage over a single man. A full mane of blonde hair fell to the middle of his back and his thin, muscular frame was adorned with a simple brown leather belt supporting a breechcloth. A series of leather straps across his chest supported two empty scabbards on his back. He wore brown leather boots and plain metal bracers. Wielding a sword-staff similar to those of the Rathalon Defenders, although shorter, the man moved in a graceful dance around the circle of goblins. After watching him twirl the weapon this way and that, Riana realized that the goblins had no advantage here. Each time the weapon moved, at least one goblin fell to the ground, clutching its head, neck, or body in pain. She was considering helping him when a goblin with a bow in hand made its way to the top of a dilapidated building. Drawing a bead on the lone man his arm pulled back, ready to let fly a wicked looking hooked arrow. Without a second thought, Riana stepped into the clearing. With the briefest moment of concentration, one of the tattoos on her body glowed brightly in chorus with her violet eyes, and she threw her left hand forward. She pointed at the goblin archer and an arc of lightning leapt from her finger tips.\nThe goblin yelped in surprise and pain as the bolt of lightning struck, enveloping it in electricity. A moment later, it fell to the ground, a smoking heap. Some of the other goblins immediately broke off from their attack on the man and headed toward her with weapons drawn. Again, she concentrated and her eyes flashed. This time, with her fingers spread wide, a fan of electricity leapt from her to the onrushing goblins. Jumping back and forth from goblin to goblin, it lit up the clearing with flashing, blue light. Half a dozen of the goblins dropped lifelessly to the ground. From nowhere, more appeared to climb over the charred bodies.\nIn a flash, Riana summoned a freezing cold whirlwind. Surrounding her in a fury of driving ice and snow, the squall swirled around her briefly before abruptly blowing itself out. A protective layer of ice armor now covered her body. Without hesitation, she waded into the group of goblins swinging Elkorine. The magical sword cut the creatures down as easily as it would stalks of grass. The goblins\u0026rsquo; various assaults chipped at the magical armor as she made her way toward the blonde man. He continued his assault on the flood of goblins, seemingly taking no notice of her own battle on his behalf.\nBefore she saw it, she felt the strands of magical ether coalescing around one of the creatures. Turning to face the goblin shaman, she heard the last words of the spell and felt the forest floor came alive with roots and vines that wrapped themselves around her legs with the strength of a vise. Her eyes flashed again as she hurled a tongue of flame at the shaman. Enveloped in a ball of fire, the creature fell to the ground screaming in pain. It had managed to call out another incantation before it fell, however. A sphere of blue energy surrounded Riana, collapsed in on her, and caused the icy armor to crumble into frost at her entangled feet.\nGoblins surrounded her as her protective enclosure dissipated. She eyed the advancing horde and knew she was in trouble. Her eyes flashed and a large fireball formed in her left hand. Throwing the ball of flame at her feet, her eyes flashed again. With a faint popping noise, she disappeared from her bondage, popping back into the clearing on the far side a second later. Staring in astonishment at the spot where Riana had been an instant before, the goblins confusion turned to determination. As they began to look around, the fireball exploded into a torrent of heat and light, engulfing everything within twenty feet of where she had been rooted to the ground. Wails of shock and pain echoed from the giant fireball before it receded into nothingness, leaving only blackened ground and desiccated goblin bodies.\n\u0026ldquo;Nice moves.\u0026rdquo; The soothing tenor voice rolled across her sensitive ears, causing them to perk up.\nTurning to find the source of the voice, Riana saw the blonde man standing a dozen feet away holding his sword-staff in one hand and grinning mischievously at her. His deep cobalt eyes twinkled as he looked at her.\n\u0026ldquo;You have some experience fighting goblins?\u0026rdquo;\nShe blushed a bit. \u0026ldquo;Never such large groups of them\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; As she realized he could see more or less her entire body, she blushed crimson from head to toe, suddenly more self conscious than she had ever been before. Trying to look anywhere else in the large clearing, but somehow always coming back to his deep blue eyes, she knew he was sizing her up.\nHe grinned again. A show of playful exuberance revealed his white teeth that may have been just a little bit too sharp.\nReflexively, Riana\u0026rsquo;s eyes rolled over his athletic body. Well toned and muscular, but not overly so, he was thin for an average human, and tall. Clean shaven, there were a series of thin braids running through his mane of blonde hair which was secured into a loose pony tail behind his neck. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure, but she thought she could detect hints of slightly darker spots in his hair.\nThe man grinned again at her roving eyes, causing her to blush a deeper red. \u0026ldquo;Well you handled yourself admir\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHe stopped short. A faint sound, the sound of a sinew bow string being drawn, nearly escaped Riana\u0026rsquo;s sharp elven hearing. Spinning around to find the source of the sound, she saw the miniscule goblin archer just as he loosed his arrow. Her eyes flashed and a bolt of lightning leapt from her fingertips, singeing the arrow as it sailed directly toward her head, but not stopping it. A flash of panic flowed through her as she watched the arrow. She didn\u0026rsquo;t have time to take another shot. \u0026lsquo;Not like this, not now. I still haven\u0026rsquo;t found my sister.\u0026rsquo; She thought as the whole world slowed down to a crawl.\nEntering her line of vision, moving faster than the arrow by a good margin, the man\u0026rsquo;s hand plucked the arrow out of the air while the tip was mere inches from her forehead.\nHe handed her the arrow and took a small metal object from his belt. In a flash of speed and a blur of motion, he spun around and flung the small metal blade, striking the confused goblin archer between the eyes and knocking him bodily from his perch.\nTurning back to Riana, still standing inches apart, he grinned broadly. \u0026ldquo;So. Come here often?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana turned away from him as her skin flushed and unfamiliar feelings rushed through her body, pretending to check the clearing for any more signs of trouble. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip; um\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;First time uh?\u0026rdquo; She felt as much as heard him move away. Stealing a glance over her shoulder, she saw him prodding a charred goblin with his right foot curiously.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; She managed a whole word somehow this time.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you here for a particular reason? Or just for the company?\u0026rdquo; His tone was light, as if everything going on were a mere game.\nRiana looked down at the arrow still clutched tightly in her hand and snapped its wooden shaft, tossing the splintered pieces to the ground at her feet. \u0026ldquo;Definitely not for the company.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I thought not.\u0026rdquo; His soothing voice slid over her like silk, but now it was coming from in front of her. Looking up, she saw that he was now poking and prodding though some of the fallen goblins packs and pouches looking for valuables.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; Riana looked over her shoulder at where he had been a moment before.\n\u0026ldquo;How did I what?\u0026rdquo; He looked up at her. \u0026ldquo;Get over here so quickly?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Uh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana looked down at the ground. \u0026ldquo;Not that I am ungrateful or anything, I just\u0026hellip; have never seen anyone move so quickly before. Not without a spell of some kind.\u0026rdquo; She hadn\u0026rsquo;t felt the build-up of magic energy that normally preceded the casting of a spell.\n\u0026ldquo;I get that a lot.\u0026rdquo; He stopped his rummaging for a moment, a thoughtful look on his face as he considered her words. Finally, he grinned again. Cobalt eyes sparkled in the motley forest light as he said half-jokingly \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m part cheetah.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana gaped at him for a moment, then grinned. \u0026ldquo;My name is Riana. I\u0026rsquo;m looking for the Goblin Chieftain. He supposedly has a key\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To the tower on the southern edge of The Bramble. Yeah, me too.\u0026rdquo; He stood up and ambled back toward her. Shifting his sword-staff to his left hand, he came to a stop in front of her. Confidently, he offered his right hand to her in greeting, \u0026ldquo;My name is Jumah. Jumah Wataru.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana sheathed Elkorine and then took the proffered hand. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s nice to meet you m\u0026rsquo;lord. Thank you for the assistance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re very welcome Riana. And please, call me Jumah. I am no lord.\u0026rdquo;\nShe flushed again but launched back into the conversation, hoping he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t see. \u0026ldquo;So, what are you seeking in the tower, Jumah?\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked at her for a moment. It was as though he was looking right into her mind and soul searching for something. His light-hearted demeanor renewed itself as he released her hand, looking back toward the dead goblins. \u0026ldquo;Nothing really. I\u0026rsquo;ve just never been there before.\u0026rdquo;\nShe gaped at him, trying to figure out what this man was thinking. \u0026ldquo;You mean to tell me, you are single handedly moving through this tribe of goblins, to get the key from their chieftain in order to enter a heavily defended, likely trap ridden tower simply because you have never been there before?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That pretty much sums it up, yeah.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you may be totally deranged.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been called much worse.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oddly enough, I believe you.\u0026rdquo; Now she was grinning from ear to ear herself.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the spirit. So, you want some company?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I told you I didn\u0026rsquo;t come here for the company.\u0026rdquo; Riana chided him playfully.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh. Right. Well then let\u0026rsquo;s just say that we are moving in the same direction at the same time through happenstance.\u0026rdquo; Jumah took his weapon in both hands and twisted the handle in the middle. It pulled cleanly apart into two separate swords which he then slid home in the crossed sheaths on his back. Bowing low before her, he swept his arms to the side indicating which direction they were headed.\nRiana shook her head with a quirky grin on her lips and headed off in the indicated direction, her new companion moving up beside her as they made their way toward where the goblin chieftain\u0026rsquo;s hut was rumored to be.\nOn to Chapter 2\n"

	"content": "\u0026lsquo;It was a dark and stormy night.\u0026rsquo;\n\u0026ldquo;At least, that\u0026rsquo;s how the story might have begun,\u0026rdquo; Riana thought as she stepped out of the gate from Talanor into the dark night and driving snow of the Southern Wastes. Briefly she nodded to the gate guards as she pulled her heavy hood over her head to protect her sensitive elven ears from the icy wind. Her body was alive with tactile sensations she had never imagined before. Every move, every turn, every breath caused her skin to scream out to her as the friction of the cloth across her now very sensitive skin sent spears of discomfort and pain to her aching head. A moment to take stock of her things and she was off into the gale, headed home.\nAs she moved further from the city, the darkness grew oppressive. The driving snow blocked out what star light would normally be visible this time of year, which wasn\u0026rsquo;t much really. The end result was that Riana was forced to shift her vision into its alternate state, allowing her to see the heat emanating from objects. In the total darkness and extreme cold, she still couldn\u0026rsquo;t see much. She could see well enough to navigate and would know instantly if anything warmer than a snowball was near her, which was a good thing, because this frozen tundra was filled to overflowing with a nasty breed of Orc.\nThese particular Orcs were about Human size, two-hundred to three-hundred pounds worth of solid muscle, and a pasty grey color with random black and dark grey/brown markings. They had sharp canine teeth that protruded from their mouths like wicked daggers, and evil eyes that glared red from beneath their boney brows.\n\u0026ldquo;The snow was as thick as bread pudding,\u0026rdquo; she whispered to herself, pulling her heavy cloak closer to try and shake the feeling of discomfort that always chased after her when she walked through the Wastes. The last thing she wanted was to attract the attention of an Orc scouting party, but hearing a voice, even her own, helped reassure her that she was still alive and well. Cautiously, she picked her way down the road, its edges barely visible to her keen thermal vision. Making every attempt to not shift or move too much, because it made the rough material of her heavy cloak rub against the sensitive, fresh tattoos covering most of her body. The dull ache in her head didn\u0026rsquo;t help things much either now that she gave it some thought.\nShe hated that she had to go to Talanor to get it done, but no other artist in the realm was better than the master there. Master Dinendal had been surprised by what she had asked him to do, even more so when she had presented him with the vials of enchanted inks that she had spent months collecting rare ingredients to distil. It had taken some time to convince him to proceed, and a good deal of coin as well. But as he worked, his confidence grew. By the time he had finished, almost three days later, he was beaming with pride in what he had created. Of course, the process had left Riana\u0026rsquo;s skin painfully sensitive. Master Dinendal had told her that normally such discomfort lasted for a week, but with the special inks and the nature of the work, he had no idea how long it would last. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t really cared at the time, but now she was beginning to regret it as the thought of a three day trudge through the southern wastes settled in on her. The prospect of what it meant in the long run was more than enough to compensate her for a few days or even weeks of discomfort. But if her skin remained this sensitive for too terribly long, she would have to seriously reconsider her wardrobe. Thinking of her closet full of the heavy robes traditionally worn by wielders of the arcane arts, their weighty fabric covering almost every inch of the body made a small groan escape her lips.\n\u0026ldquo;Mom\u0026rsquo;s going to absolutely KILL me.\u0026rdquo; She whispered to herself as she continued threading her way down the snow-packed road, headed for home.\n\u0026ldquo;For what?\u0026rdquo; An echo of her own voice whispered next to her, causing her to nearly fall over in surprise. Turning sharply towards the voice, her cloak shifted and twirled around her, dragging itself painfully across her freshly tattooed body. Wincing in pain, she saw her sister standing in the middle of the road, looking at her innocently. It was like looking in a mirror, which made sense, since they were twins. Katrina had the high, thin cheek bones of a royal elf, her long, pointed ears concealed beneath her own cloak\u0026rsquo;s hood. Her thin lips parted in a devilish grin, revealing slightly too sharp teeth that was a subtle indication of their mixed heritage. Her fine features were soft and attractive, even for the young Twenty years old they were. There were some differences though. Katrina\u0026rsquo;s eyes were an acidy yellow and she wore her fine, platinum hair down, in a manageable style, while Riana\u0026rsquo;s eyes were a deep violet, and her hair was pulled back into a fancy array of \u0026lsquo;pony tails\u0026rsquo; at the back of her skull, with a few strands hanging down around her face. At some point she had managed to turn her hair a vibrant, royal purple in an accident at the alchemy table. It had grown that way ever since and she had finally, after more than a year of trying, given up attempting to conceal it from their mother by dying it regularly. Their mother had sighed when she saw it coming in, in all its purple glory, then looked at Riana and said, \u0026ldquo;Just like your\u0026hellip;father.\u0026rdquo; She had then hugged her and walked away with a strange look on her face, the memory of the father they had never known clearly haunting her.\nLooking deeply into her sister\u0026rsquo;s eyes through the driving snow, Riana smiled weakly, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll tell you when we get home. I need to get out of these clothes and into something lighter. This is definitely not the weather for it.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina admonished her with a parental look and then asked, \u0026ldquo;Why are you walking home? Didn\u0026rsquo;t you buy a portal ring while you were in Talanor?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana sighed the sigh of sisterly defeat. \u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; she finally admitted, \u0026ldquo;I spent all my money on\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She took a deep breath before continuing, \u0026ldquo;well, you\u0026rsquo;ll see when we get home.\u0026rdquo; Her voice trailed off.\nKatrina smiled, grinned rather, from ear to ear. \u0026ldquo;Then let\u0026rsquo;s get home, and out of this weather, so I can see what you did! C\u0026rsquo;mere sis!\u0026rdquo; At that, a slender hand emerged from beneath her cloak, in its delicate fingers she held a portal ring. Its shiny gold band adorned with the vibrant, almost glowing ruby that was the symbol of their home city of Rathalon. She placed the ring on her finger and with a grin at Riana, turned it one-hundred eighty degrees, so the ruby was facing down.\nThe ring began to glow brightly for a moment, and an instant later, the light was gone. Between the girls appeared a series of red rings of magical energy floating in a column. They appeared to be composed of pure light, bobbing up and down lazily like a buoy might while floating in a calm harbor. Riana looked at her sister and saw the ring on her finger crumble away into nothingness.\nKatrina smiled and shrugged, \u0026ldquo;I still can\u0026rsquo;t afford a rechargeable one, but these are pretty reasonable.\u0026rdquo; Then she stepped into the column of glowing rings and disappeared in a dull flash of red light.\nWith a sigh of resignation and a brief wish that her head would stop its aching, Riana stepped into the column of rings and instantly found herself in a large, stone room, surrounded on all sides by armed guards. All of whom were looking at her expectantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Ssstate your name and bussinesss.\u0026rdquo; An imposing reptilian hissed at her from directly ahead. She looked at the guard. An impressive creature, standing some eight feet tall and heavy with strong, sinuous muscles, he towered over her lithe six foot frame. The deep emerald-green of his scales was accentuated by the golden plate armor of the Rathalon guard. In one hand he bore the signature weapon of the Rathalon Defenders, a short metal staff with a wickedly pointed blade jutting out of each end. The weapon was easily as tall as the creature holding it and was known throughout Kalijor as a vicious weapon that required a great deal of skill to use effectively. The weapon hung in his hand like a toy, despite its mass. His bright amber eyes stared at her unblinking from beneath the helmet that had been custom fit to his reptilian head. Although Riana had seen and talked with Captain Sselina on many occasions, she was still caught off guard every time she used the portal system and found him staring at her expectantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Riana Thorindal, daughter of Ezrina Thorindal. My sister Katrina and I are on our way home.\u0026rdquo; Indicating Katrina, who stood behind the captain, speaking in hushed tones to a merchant near the exit of the arrival area. Riana pushed her hood off her head revealing herself to the guards and causing a brief surge of pain. Her long ears perked up in the warmth and the presence of friends.\nThe Captain eyed her for a moment, before he nodded ever so slightly in her direction. \u0026ldquo;Welcome home Lady Thorindal.\u0026rdquo; Then he made a barely perceptible gesture and the rest of the guards stood down and went about checking other arrivals.\n\u0026ldquo;Good to see you again Captain,\u0026rdquo; Riana said, feeling much more at ease now. She moved out of the inbound portal area where other people were arriving in brief red flashes. Rathalon was the center of Kalijor. As the mecca of commerce and travel, it was the largest city in the world. Everyone came through Rathalon at one point or another in their lives. A great many of those arrivals simply appeared here in the cavernous portal chamber. Looking around the room as she moved away from the arrival area, Riana felt the enormity of the chamber. It was a gigantic room designed with security in mind, with numerous large columns arranged in rows that would allow defenders to take cover from any invading force, firing arrows, bolts and spell missiles from positions of cover at the central area of the building where all arrivals appeared. Twenty steps led down into the arrival area, which was a giant octagon, some one-hundred feet across, giving the defenders a tactical advantage in the event of an attack through the portal system, by placing any would-be attackers well below the city defenders.\nPeople flowed in and out of the building through the gigantic, intricately-carved main doors. Some headed toward the smaller, raised octagonal platforms that held glowing portals similar to the one that had brought Katrina and herself here to Rathalon, but these portals were a shimmering yellow, and always very busy. There were six such platforms in the portal chamber of Rathalon, but only five of them had portals atop them. One platform in the far back corner of the room, stood empty. There had not been a portal there for so long that no one remembered where it had gone when it had been active.\nMaking her way up the short stair way, she nodded to the Captain, and offered him a wry smile. He offered her the reptilian equivalent, baring rows of small, deadly sharp teeth. Then he moved further down the stairs to intervene in some dispute that had started up with one of the arrivals.\nRiana wove her way through a few small groups of people that were milling about, causing her heavy cloak to drag across her skin. Gritting her teeth and forcing back the pain, she made her way to her sister\u0026rsquo;s side.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey Ree.\u0026rdquo; Kat said at her sister\u0026rsquo;s approach, \u0026ldquo;One sec and I\u0026rsquo;ll be done here.\u0026rdquo; Then she went back to haggling with the merchant about something or other.\nRiana took a moment to pull off her heavy cloak, careful to cause as little friction with her body as possible. The silk skirt and blouse she wore underneath helped some, but she was still painfully aware of what she had done to her body. The garments she had picked for the trip had been chosen with two thoughts in mind, reducing friction against her sensitive skin and to cover her up as much as possible.\nCarefully holding her cloak in her hands, out away from her body so as to keep it from bumping into her, she turned back to her sister just as Katrina concluded whatever negotiation she had been involved in.\nKatrina grinned at her, stifling a laugh at the sight of her sister. \u0026ldquo;WHAT?!\u0026rdquo; Riana howled indignantly.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said, almost unable to hold back the laughter. \u0026ldquo;You just look like\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Like what?!\u0026rdquo; Riana asked, raising an eyebrow, her ears straight back from her head in annoyance.\n\u0026ldquo;Like\u0026hellip;an old maid\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina finished, and finally burst into laughter, unable to contain it any longer.\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s skin flushed red in embarrassment, her ears drooping down. \u0026ldquo;I guess I do.\u0026rdquo; She said, sounding upset.\nThe blouse had long, billowing sleeves that came to a buttoned cuff at each wrist, and ended at the neck in a fancy collar that she didn\u0026rsquo;t care for, but it served its purpose very effectively. Her skirt was long, ruffled, and of the same fine silk. Ending below her ankles, it almost completely covered her traveling boots, which were soft brown leather, and came up to her knees beneath the skirt. She knew it was not the best traveling attire, but she had other concerns to worry about on this particular trip. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t even wearing her normal belt with her short sword, knife and pouches on it.\nSuddenly Katrina grew very serious, the laughter gone, but still audible in her words, \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mon Ree, let\u0026rsquo;s go home so you can show me.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that, the two of them were off. Weaving in and out of the throngs of travelers. Deftly avoiding traffic jams, as only two children could. The pain of moving nearly floored her, but Riana resolved to get home before giving up her secret. Her head hurt and her body ached, as she pushed herself to keep up with her sister. In an instant they were at the massive doors to the portal chamber. Then they were outside, in the full light of day. The momentary transition from night to day had taken place while they were inside the portal chamber, and now people were beginning to come out of their homes and add to the volume of travelers already thronging through the smooth, stone streets of the city. They wove their way through the crowds -down a back alley here, through someone\u0026rsquo;s yard there, under a street merchant\u0026rsquo;s awning, between two horse-drawn carts- making and taking every shortcut they could. As she strained the limits of her body to force it to keep up with her sister\u0026rsquo;s pace, Riana began to realize just how far away home was. Every step she took caused her clothing, as well chosen as it was, to light up her nerve endings like a bonfire. Every time they dodged around someone or ducked under a clothesline, her body screamed out at her to stop. Slowly, she began to fall behind, even though she was pushing herself well past her pain threshold.\nRathalon was a gigantic city. The largest in Kalijor by far. Its population was in the millions, if you included all of the transients that were there at any time, although its actual residents numbered only five or six hundred thousand people. It had been carved from the head of the Uraval Mountains over the course of centuries. The spot was perfect as travelers had to round the head of the mountain range on their way from one side to the other. The mountains themselves were impassable. Not so much because of the treacherous terrain, which there was plenty of, but because something lived up there. Something less than friendly to travelers. And no one was known to have ever made it over the range. So all travelers had long ago taken to rounding the head of the range. And before too long, a great undertaking was begun. Some of the best stone cutters in the world had banded together and drawn up plans for something amazing. They decided to build a city at the head of the mountains in order to capitalize on the traffic that passed there, but their city would be nothing short of spectacular. So they began removing stone from the face of the mountain, and for generations they carried on removing stone from the mountain. Their children toiled away at it, and their children\u0026rsquo;s children.\nThe city was still not completed to this day, but it was the most amazing thing Riana had ever laid eyes upon. A city capable of housing millions of people, carved from the head of the mountains. All of the buildings they ran past on their way home, the streets that they had learned so well in their youth, the walking paths where they used to play tag among the pedestrians of the city, the fountains Riana and Katrina had learned to swim in, all of it carved from the rock. Not a single piece had been brought in, or added to, any feature of the city. Even the massive stone gates of the thick outer wall, were hewn from the mountain\u0026rsquo;s mass, hinges and all; Riana waved at the gate guards as they darted past the one-hundred foot tall gates, the action sending lines of fire up the nerves in her arm and chest, she staggered momentarily, but forced herself up and on after her sister.\nThe great wall that surrounded the city was one-hundred fifty feet high, and twenty five feet thick. Leaving the vertical face at the southern edge of the city, it extended northward and curved around to the west and back south to reconnect with the same vertical face. The girls ran along the base of the wall, towards their house. In her hyper-sensitive state, Riana was relieved by the realization that the glossy surface of the city\u0026rsquo;s wall was actually as smooth as it looked. For years she had been amazed at how its near mirror surface would dimly reflect its surroundings, but now she was in heaven as she leaned against its cool surface and slid painlessly down the road.\nThere were fewer merchants on this road, but it was still a high traffic area and a great many people bought and sold, and just moved from place to place here. As they dodged through a crowd at the edge of the street, Riana brushed against a large man in heavy plate armor. He barely touched her svelte form, but the result was instant and startling to those in the area. Her skin sang its discomfort out to her nerves, sending her sprawling to the ground at the foot of one of the city\u0026rsquo;s freestanding buildings. People stopped what they where doing and looked at the young elf, sprawled across the ground in a tangled mess. Tears of pain forming in her eyes at some unknown and unseen torture. Riana looked up at the man as he was staring down at her in confusion, trying to stammer an apology, \u0026ldquo;Miss, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, I didn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s fine! Just had a rough day!\u0026rdquo; Katrina was next to her, hoisting her off the ground, not realizing that her embrace was adding to her sister\u0026rsquo;s pain.\nRiana focused her thoughts on shutting out the pain and tried to get her body to obey her commands, wincing as her sister dragged her away from the crowd.\nOnce they rounded a corner, Katrina braced her sister against a wall to let her catch her breath. \u0026ldquo;Wow Ree. What was THAT all about?\u0026rdquo; Her face was distorted with worry for her sister, ears drooping low in concern.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be okay Kat. I just need a minute.\u0026rdquo; Riana said, wiping tears from her eyes. Finally she willed her body back into her control and stood up. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get home.\u0026rdquo; She added weakly.\nAlmost home now, Riana gazed southward at the sheer rock face that stood thousands of feet high, towering over the rest of the city. In the face were carved balconies and windows, from top to bottom. Tens of thousands of people lived in the apartments carved into the cliff. In the center of the city, visible to the sisters as they crossed the last major intersection before reaching their building, was the palace where the governing party of Rathalon presided over the day-to-day activities of the city. It was a series of buildings in a square, interspersed with a few fountains, a few gardens and some grassy knolls. It was only called the palace because of its appearance however, as there was no actual royalty governing the city; rather, a group of elected citizens that served a term and then went back to their lives.\nThe streets teemed with life day and night. All civilized species were welcomed with open arms here, and most could be seen on any given day. As was evidenced by the mixed group the sisters wove through, their final destination in sight. Katrina sidestepped around a felinoid and then ducked between an Ogre\u0026rsquo;s legs as Riana barely managed to get her complaining body out of the way of the wildly gesticulating arms of a Troll that was excitedly telling the crowd about some amazing point of interest or other in his last journey to the far reaches. Those of Riana and Katrina\u0026rsquo;s race, the Elves, were in the minority by far with maybe a dozen families living within the city. Most of the elves tended to live closer to nature, in Pandoria, or even in one of the world\u0026rsquo;s forests in unofficial cities that most sentients didn\u0026rsquo;t even suspect existed.\nThe sisters approached their home, causing Riana to breathe a sigh of relief at the thought that she could soon shed the clothing that was causing her so much discomfort. Her relief was short lived however, as two things occurred to her. First, she was going to have to show her body to her mother soon. Secondly, they lived at the top of a three story building on the western edge of the city, which meant she still had three flights of stairs to get up. Living in the building with their own family were two other elven families, each fairly wealthy, either by heritage, or by enterprise. They burst through the front door and charged up the stairs to the door of their home. The spacious apartment consisted of four bed chambers, a living area, a study, a kitchen, two bath rooms, and had running water, both hot and cold, provided by the city\u0026rsquo;s talented architects and designers.\nThe door to their apartment opened as soon as one of them touched it then closed again behind them. Katrina grabbed Riana by the hand and gently pulled her toward Riana\u0026rsquo;s room.\nKatrina moved Riana to the center of the elegantly appointed room, stripped her cloak out of her hands, and tossed it on the king size four-poster bed made of a dark, hard-wood with silk and chiffon hangings draped down at the corners as she spun around. Knocking the door closed and flopping down on a large pile of satin and velvet throw-pillows, she pulled her knees up to her chest and planted her feet in the plush rug that covered the stone floor. Katrina steepled her fingers together and set her chin on her finger tips, staring calmly at her sister.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok,\u0026rdquo; she said, \u0026ldquo;show me.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked at her, her eyes glazed over in something approaching abject terror. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know Kat. I\u0026rsquo;m kind of scared.\u0026rdquo; She would have wrapped her arms tightly about her body and rolled up into a ball, but she feared the pain it caused might be worse than her feelings about what her sister would think.\n\u0026ldquo;It CAN\u0026rsquo;T be that bad Ree. Seriously. Show me?\u0026rdquo; Katrina was sincere.\n\u0026ldquo;Just you wait.\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she began to unbutton her blouse, hands trembling, \u0026ldquo;You may yet change your tune.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina bit her lower lip as she watched her sister slowly open her blouse. She was stunned, her mouth having fallen open as she stared at the slowly revealed intricate pattern of dark lines weaving around, serpent-like on her sister\u0026rsquo;s alabaster skin. They covered most of her upper body. From her wrists up to her shoulders and down her torso. The markings were not so tightly packed as to cover all of her skin, in fact, most of her skin was untouched, but the spacing of the patterns was such that very little of her body was far from some type of mark.\nHer back was covered as well, Katrina noticed as Riana slowly turned around, her ears drooping down in an obvious display of her uncertainty and concern for her sister\u0026rsquo;s reaction.\nFinally Katrina realized Riana was staring at her expectantly. \u0026ldquo;Ree\u0026hellip; I had no idea\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Slowly she stood up and approached her sister, inspecting the complex patterns more closely.\n\u0026ldquo;Are these Draconic?\u0026rdquo; She wondered aloud, reaching out to touch one of the marks on Riana\u0026rsquo;s stomach. As she touched it, Riana flinched away, almost falling over. Katrina grabbed her sister\u0026rsquo;s outstretched hand, stabilizing her before she completely lost her balance. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Ree, I imagine they are still sensitive uh?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana nodded her agreement. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Kat. And yes, they are Draconic. It was the only language I could find in my research that would effectively do what I needed in single symbols.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina nodded gravely, pretending to understand. She could recognize Draconic, but not actually read it. \u0026ldquo;Why did you do this?\u0026rdquo; was all she could think to ask as she reached out and stopped short of touching another of the vibrant marks.\nRiana sighed, a full confession approaching her lips. \u0026ldquo;I was doing some research. Trying to find a way around the limitations of our mages. They, all of them, even you, can only cast so many spells at any given time. They require you to memorize them, and you can only memorize so many. They take concentration to cast, and time to speak the incantations. I was trying to find a way around all of that. And eventually I did.\u0026rdquo; She sighed again, still unsure of herself.\n\u0026ldquo;Go on.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said reassuringly as she moved around her sister, inspecting each and every line with intense scrutiny.\n\u0026ldquo;I found an ancient tome in the academy library. Back in the restricted section\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina stood bolt upright, almost knocking Riana over again. Her eyes as big as saucers, and ears standing straight up in amazement. The restricted section of the academy library was one of the most attentively guarded areas in all of Kalijor. Some of the books there were written before the great war, and contained spells and incantations so powerful that they could, and in fact had, leveled whole cities. Sneaking into the restricted area was not unheard of, Katrina had done it herself on more than one occasion just to see if she could; But to remain there undetected, for long enough to do real research, was something indeed!\n\u0026ldquo;I know,\u0026rdquo; Riana said narrowing her eyes. \u0026ldquo;That was almost the most difficult part of this whole ordeal. Next to having to tell mom.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina giggled at that, and then crouched down again, resuming her inspection.\n\u0026ldquo;So I found a book that detailed the research of a mage from before the war who sought very much the same thing.\u0026rdquo; Riana paused before continuing, \u0026ldquo;he found that if he used the correct ingredients in his inks, and had them enchanted in just the right way, then he could have certain magical symbols permanently applied to his skin. It let him use the associated spells with little concentration, and no time memorizing them. The only problem he encountered was that he could only make it work with a single symbol for each spell, and he lacked the knowledge to divine appropriate symbols for all of his spells.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina blurted out, \u0026ldquo;The Dragons have symbols for EVERYTHING! They invented most of our magics!!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Exactly,\u0026rdquo; Riana replied. \u0026ldquo;So all I had to do was learn their written language. No small task, to be sure, but very possible. After that, it was merely about setting up my spell books, and convincing the Master in Talanor to do it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do they\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina gestured randomly about Riana\u0026rsquo;s body, \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;work?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Watch,\u0026rdquo; Riana said with a touch of pride in her voice. She held out her hand and closed her eyes for an instant before a small ball of fire appeared in her outstretched hand. Katrina inspected the mark that had glowed as if in response to her sister\u0026rsquo;s thoughts. The intricate pattern had glowed vividly for an instant in vibrant color before fading back to black. The flame hovered there in her hand, exactly as it would if she had conjured it through the normal, accepted means.\nKatrina held her hand over the flame, as if to verify that it was real and not some kind of illusion or trick. Feeling the heat from it, she closed her hand around it as she recited a quelling incantation. Several seconds later the flame disappeared with a flicker.\nLooking at her sister, eyes wide again, then to the rest of the intricate pattern spreading across her body. \u0026ldquo;Your legs as well?\u0026rdquo; She queried, amazement in her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; Riana said flatly. \u0026ldquo;Both legs, from the lower calf up to the waist.\u0026rdquo; At that, she lifted the hem of her skirt and showed one of her legs to her sister. The marks were there as well, standing out in stark contrast to her light skin.\nKatrina was in awe. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t know you could CAST this many spells!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t yet.\u0026rdquo; Riana said. Now she was almost glowing with pride. \u0026ldquo;I included all of the arcane spells that I could find in the library. You see this?\u0026rdquo; She pointed to a symbol on her forearm.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Kat said with an eyebrow quirked.\n\u0026ldquo;This is a spell I know how to cast. It\u0026rsquo;s a sphere of light cantrip. But this one here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana pointed to another, more elaborate image on the bicep of the same arm. \u0026ldquo;This is a fire ball spell that I have never cast before. Most mages can\u0026rsquo;t for years. But as soon as I am able to channel the appropriate level of power, I will be able to use this one. I just need to keep practicing my focus and channeling abilities.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ree\u0026hellip; This is\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana winced as she waited for her sister to finish her thought, to tell her she was insane, or stupid, anything but what came next. \u0026ldquo;This is AMAZING!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana sighed heavily, relief flowing through her body. If Katrina could accept it that well, then their mother may just go mildly crazy, rather than kill her outright. Gently, she sat down on the edge of the bed and held her head.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter Ree?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked with a tone of concern, sitting down beside her sister on the edge of the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;My head has been aching for a while. Nothing major. Just kind of a constant, dull pain.\u0026rdquo; She said, as she massaged her temples with her finger tips.\n\u0026ldquo;Since the tattoos?\u0026rdquo; Katrina said, obviously thinking there was some kind of connection.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Riana came back quickly. \u0026ldquo;Since a week or so before that. Somewhere in the middle of studying up for the tattoos. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what brought it on.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Over a week?! Have you taken something?\u0026rdquo; Katrina was looking more worried by the moment.\n\u0026ldquo;No, silly!\u0026rdquo; Now it was Riana\u0026rsquo;s turn to admonish her sister, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve been saying nice things to it in hopes it will get a confidence boost and move on to greener pastures!\u0026rdquo; Grinning wickedly at her sister, Riana punched her lightly on the shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Anyway, it isn\u0026rsquo;t as bad as all that. Just kind of inconvenient. I need to find something to wear before mom gets home from Cohai. Help me pick something out Kat?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course!\u0026rdquo; Katrina said as she jumped off the edge of the bed. The headache temporarily forgotten in favor of a trip to the bazaar. \u0026ldquo;What did you have in mind?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Something\u0026hellip; rather more daring than usual I think\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana said as a mischievous grin formed on her lips.\nOn to Chapter 2\n"

	"content": "My name is Paul Lell. I grew up in and around Arvada, Colorado (excepting a two year stint in Kansas because of my father\u0026rsquo;s work). I attended Arvada West High School, graduating in 1992. In 1994 I moved to Pueblo, Colorado where I spent five years attending the educational institute formerly known as the University of Southern Colorado. I started off as an engineering major (leaning toward civil engineering) until one day in the middle of an advanced trigonometry class I had a sudden epiphany: I no longer enjoyed doing math. Don\u0026rsquo;t get me wrong, I love numbers and I loved algebra and geometry, even right triangle trig was fun, but when they started taking all of the numbers out of the equations, I began to lose interest.\nSo I moved on to my next passion, art. Specifically computer animation and 3D modeling. I stayed in the art department until I left the University in 1999 and joined the work force back in Denver.\nI am the father of two wonderful boys and we make our home in Westminster, Colorado with my wonderful wife who serves innumerable side duties as mother, wife, editor, artist, financial consultant, and a myriad of other tasks that I may never know.\nI write every chance I get. At lunch while at the office, in the mornings before anyone else gets up, late at night after everyone else has gone to bed, you name it. \u0026lsquo;The First Key of Kalijor\u0026rsquo; took me just over a year to write and its initial heavy editing was done by my wife who holds multiple bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees (In English and CIS).\nMy interests range all over, with focus on Science Fiction and Fantasy subject matter. I love taking in a movie on the couch or in the theater. I read whenever possible and whatever I can get hold of when the time avails itself. I have played pen and paper role playing games since I was in grade school, usually as the DM/GM of the campaigns, except when Tyler took the helm (thanks for the breaks Ty! I really miss playing sometimes!). I think that is probably what helped develop my interest in story telling. I play video games on any platform I can get my hands on, mostly adventure and RPG fare, but I like a good beat\u0026rsquo;em up or driver as well.\n"

	"content": "\u0026ldquo;Where are we going?\u0026rdquo; I asked, clutching my fluffy pillow to my chest and following Mom out to the car. It was still early, four-thirty in the morning, I think. Mom had asked me to pack last night, and I\u0026rsquo;d known about the trip for a couple weeks now, but they still hadn\u0026rsquo;t told me where it was we were going.\n\u0026ldquo;To the mountains, honey. Remember Uncle Joe\u0026rsquo;s place? We\u0026rsquo;re going to stay up there for a while,\u0026rdquo; Mom replied with a tone of concern.\u0026nbsp;\nI did remember Uncle Joe\u0026rsquo;s cabin. It was warm and cozy and had a big fireplace I could sit by and read for hours on end while everyone was out playing in the snow. I didn\u0026rsquo;t care for the snow or the cold, personally, which made our surprise exodus from our Denver home that much more unwelcome. It was starting to snow. And it didn\u0026rsquo;t help at all that both Mom and Dad appeared to be operating under a mild, silent fright as they packed the van. Their luggage looked hastily packed and the normal, Tetris-like efficiency that they usually packed the van with was nowhere to be seen. Something was bothering them.\n\u0026ldquo;Is everything okay?\u0026rdquo; I asked, fixing my eyes on my mom as she looked up at me.\nShe met my eyes for a long moment, then tore hers away and looked over her shoulder, down the street. She took a deep breath before responding, \u0026ldquo;We aren\u0026rsquo;t sure, honey. We\u0026rsquo;ve heard there\u0026rsquo;s a Quanta squad moving up the street, checking houses for unregistered mages.\u0026rdquo;\nA cold chill ran through me at that and I sank down into my chair. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know much about Quanta, but I did know that they policed magic-users and that it was technically illegal to use magic without getting a license to do so from them. But, as I understood it, most people couldn\u0026rsquo;t do magic at all without going through Quanta training and getting cybernetic implants. Most people weren\u0026rsquo;t like me.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; I responded, twisting around to face forward and slumping into the back seat of the minivan. \u0026ldquo;Will we be coming back?\u0026rdquo; I asked.\nAt that, my dad climbed into the van and kneeled in front of me, taking my hands in his. He could have closed one of his hands around both of mine with little effort. He looked at me and smiled, squeezing my hands with one of his and pointing out the window to the big cottonwood in the front yard with the other. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, Ben,\u0026rdquo; he said. \u0026ldquo;Remember the tree?\u0026rdquo;\nLooking where he pointed, I remembered our nights lying on the ground under the tree and watching the sunsets together and nodded. \u0026ldquo;They never forget,\u0026rdquo; I replied.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s right, Ben,\u0026rdquo; he nodded. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll all be okay, as long as we keep one another in our hearts. This is just a place, whether we come back or not. What\u0026rsquo;s important is our memories, okay?\u0026rdquo;\nNodding at him, he gave me a smile, patted my hands, then backed out of the van and resumed packing with mom. Without another word, I pulled the seatbelt into place.\nI watched the automatic door slide closed in the late evening light of the aging day. Before it finished closing though, the tailgate opened and Dad huffed a couple of times, lifting some things in behind the seats. \u0026ldquo;Geez, Ben, how many books did you pack in here?\u0026rdquo; he asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Only eleven,\u0026rdquo; I looked back at him. \u0026ldquo;Mom said I couldn\u0026rsquo;t bring them all.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Did you leave any space for clothes?\u0026rdquo; he asked, looking nervously down the street.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course,\u0026rdquo; I beamed back at him, trying to lighten the mood. \u0026ldquo;I read about the optimal way to fold and roll my clothes so I could fit two weeks worth in half as much space as the last time I packed for that long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course you did,\u0026rdquo; he nodded, distracted. \u0026ldquo;Okay, couple more minutes and we\u0026rsquo;re on the road. You all ready?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; I nodded, rubbing sleep from my eyes and peering down the street through the van\u0026rsquo;s side window. A pair of dark gray vehicles sat on the side of the road a block or so away, both of them parked at strange angles in front of a house in such a way as to make it difficult for people in the street to pass them and impossible for people in the house\u0026rsquo;s driveway to leave. \u0026ldquo;Is that them?\u0026rdquo; I asked, pointing.\nDad\u0026rsquo;s gaze followed my finger and as soon as he laid eyes on those cars, he started to shiver and glance around nervously. \u0026ldquo;Dammit,\u0026rdquo; he said under his breath, maybe thinking I hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard him. \u0026ldquo;Stay put Ben,\u0026rdquo; he added. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll get your mom and we\u0026rsquo;ll get going.\u0026rdquo;\nA few minutes later, we were all in the van and headed toward the highway. I watched my parents whisper back and forth quite a lot for the first part of the trip. They kept looking over their shoulders and down every side street, as if they expected the Quanta boogeyman to leap out at us from any corner or alley.\u0026nbsp;\nAn hour or so later, as we emerged from the Eisenhower Tunnel, we were greeted with the worst snowstorm I\u0026rsquo;d ever seen in my life. Dad slowed us down to a crawl because, even with the rows of super-bright lights singing either side of the road, there was little more than the light of our headlights to drive by. The snow was so thick we could barely see the car in front of us. It looked like we were on the bridge of the millennium falcon going into hyperspace.\nWe crawled down the hill, pulled off in Silverthorn, and stopped to get breakfast at the fast food place right off the highway. Mom and Dad talked quite a lot about whether or not they wanted to press on in the terrible weather, given their urgency. They spoke to a couple of locals while I sipped some hot chocolate and stared out the window at the crazy amount of snow dumping out of the sky. I created little swirls and eddies in the downpour with a twitch of my finger, bending the snow with my will as I waited for them to decide what would come next. I was just mesmerized by the beauty of the snow, backlit by the faint glow of what little light managed to wind its way through the mass from the artificial sources surrounding the parking lot.\nBefore long we were back in the van though, so obviously they had decided to press on toward Kremmling and then Steamboat. It was on the road to Kremmling that my life took its first turn down a dark, frightening path from which it would never return. I remember we were more than two hours out of Silverthorn, which on any normal day would have put us well inside the city limits of Steamboat, our final destination. But that day, we still had yet to see Kremmling. My parents said we were a little over halfway there when the snow got so bad that we couldn\u0026rsquo;t even see the end of the van\u0026rsquo;s stubby little hood. I tried to divert the snow around the car to add to the visibility, but there was so much of it that even creating an area around us with no snow in it just created an impenetrable wall of white beyond the range of my ability.\nDad tried to scoot along the edge of the road, using the reflective marker posts there to just stay on the asphalt but, after only a couple minutes of that, decided it was far too dangerous to carry on that way. Instead, he just put the van in park, turned on the hazard lights, and we all dug in a little bit to wait out the storm.\u0026nbsp;\nMaybe twenty minutes later, we heard the sound of an approaching engine and what sounded like something scraping on the road. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t far off and sounded like it was coming at us fast, but we still couldn\u0026rsquo;t see more than a couple feet outside the van. Mom and Dad rolled down their windows, hanging their heads out into the snow to try to get a better look without the reflectivity of the glass and our headlights and a second later, I heard Mom scream. My dad started shouting something, waving his arms wildly in the snow with a flashlight in one hand, trying to get someone\u0026rsquo;s attention. Mom pulled her head in, looked over her shoulder with panic on her face and said, \u0026ldquo;Hold on, Ben. Hold on tight.\u0026rdquo;\nThose were the last words I ever heard my mother say. And it was the last time I ever saw either of them.\nI remember a column of bright yellow sparks approaching the front of the van, and I remember a loud crashing noise. I remember, just before the crash, my emotions welled up inside me and exploded outward, creating a sphere of clear weather a hundred feet in diameter. I remember seeing the snowplow bearing down on us, too close for anyone to do anything about it, except maybe me. I pushed with all my might, forcing my will into the effort and sending out a wall of force that washed out from me, tearing the front off the van, shattering the plow on the front of the on-rushing truck, smashing its windshield, and utterly failing to stop the vehicle. Then everything turned upside down and, while I know it\u0026rsquo;s entirely impossible, I remember my fluffy pillow, floating in the air in front of me. I reached out to grab it, my hair floating in a dark halo around my head, but just as I was about to snag it, there was another loud bang, the sound of crashing glass, a rush of cold, wet air and snow, and then darkness.\nDarkness. And cold.\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 3\n"

	"content": "-Interlude 1-\n\u0026ldquo;We have a new student today, class. Her name is Apricot Jones. Apricot, would you like to say hello to everyone?\u0026rdquo;\nI stood up, pressing my knee-length skirt flat, then brushed a lock of my long brown hair behind my ear. Smiling at the teacher and offering an enthusiastic nod, I announced, \u0026ldquo;Hello, everyone. I\u0026rsquo;m Apricot Jones and I\u0026rsquo;m super excited to be here. This school has the highest rating of any other middle school in the area.\u0026rdquo;\nA collective eye roll and groan washed through the room, but the other students could not dull my spirits. I begged my father for three months to enroll me here because of the school\u0026rsquo;s performance in academic standardized tests and college placement out of the high school across the street that this school fed into. I was most certainly going to make it work. I had big plans to become an astrophysicist and join the space program. It didn\u0026rsquo;t matter to me that magic had already provided all of the answers to successful space flight on the cheap. We still need good scientists with an understanding of the mechanics of the universe to push forward the boundaries of human knowledge. Only through advancing science could we further advance magic anyway.\n\u0026ldquo;Apricot,\u0026rdquo; the teacher cut off the groans of my new classmates with a gentle voice. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re reading \u0026lsquo;The Count of Monte Cristo\u0026rsquo; this semester. You\u0026rsquo;re a couple weeks behind, but\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s okay, Miss Holyfield. I read it two years ago,\u0026rdquo; I announced, beaming with pride. But when I looked around the room, the other students were all glaring at me with the same malice I had come to expect from students in my last school. My smile faltered a bit, but I pushed back, rekindling it through sheer force of will. \u0026ldquo;I liked it quite a bit. It\u0026rsquo;s one of my favorite Dumas books, although \u0026lsquo;The Walking Drum\u0026rsquo; was also very good. Currently I am reading \u0026lsquo;Philosophi\u0026aelig; Naturalis Principia Mathematica\u0026rsquo; by Sir Isaac Newton, \u0026lsquo;A brief History of Time\u0026rsquo; by Stephen Hawking, \u0026lsquo;The Dragons of Eden\u0026rsquo; by Carl Sagan, and \u0026lsquo;The Ashes of Worlds\u0026rsquo; by Kevin J. Anderson.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re reading all those books at once, Apricot?\u0026rdquo; Miss Holyfield asked, a disbelieving eyebrow raised in my direction. Just like all my previous teachers.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes, Miss,\u0026rdquo; I nodded.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s lying!\u0026rdquo; the blonde girl seated next to my desk shouted, pointing at me.\n\u0026ldquo;Now, Jennifer, it isn\u0026rsquo;t nice to accuse people like that. I\u0026rsquo;m sure Apricot is just joking with us.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No, I\u0026rsquo;m not,\u0026rdquo; I stated. \u0026ldquo;Newton invented Calculus to explain the movement of celestial bodies and his innovation led to our modern understanding of orbital mechanics and space travel. Carl Sagan was one of the best science communicators in history and did more to advance the growth of astrophysics than any single scientist before him, not to mention the dozens of minds he enriched and sent out into the world to advance our understanding of the universe. I\u0026rsquo;m going to be an astrophysicist. And I\u0026rsquo;m going to get into the space program and become an astronaut!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re a dork,\u0026rdquo; Jennifer spat at me, eliciting a rumble of chuckles from the rest of the class.\nMy smile deflated. Why couldn\u0026rsquo;t the other students let me be, no matter where I was? All I wanted was to read, learn, and not be ridiculed for my passions. Why was being smarter than everyone a crime worthy of derision, but being faster or stronger than everyone was something to be celebrated? Besides, I worked my butt off for my grades. Did they think it was easy?\n\u0026ldquo;Jennifer!\u0026rdquo; Miss Holyfield snapped.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, Miss Holyfield,\u0026rdquo; Jennifer intoned, then narrowed her eyes at me as the teacher moved back to her desk to set down her attendance ledger.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, I can see we\u0026rsquo;re going to have our work cut out for us in keeping up with you, Miss Jones. Hopefully we\u0026rsquo;ll give you a surprise or two along the way. For now, though, please take your seat and everyone open your books to the chapter on Salvador Dali.\u0026rdquo; Miss Holyfield turned toward the whiteboard and began writing as I sat down at my desk.\nI retrieved my immaculate three-ring binder and freshly-issued textbook from my shoulder bag and laid them on my desk. Beside me, Jennifer leaned over and hissed in my ear, \u0026ldquo;You ~are~ a dork. And Apricot is a stupid name.\u0026rdquo;\nDetermination welled up inside me as Miss Holyfield explained about how Salvador Dali was known for keeping an Ocelot as a pet, and even managed to convince a woman in a restaurant that it was a house cat simply painted to look like an Ocelot. Apparently, she\u0026rsquo;d believed him and gone on about her meal. After all, he was Salvador Dali. Who was she to question him?\nAs I sat there listening to Miss Holyfield talk about Dali\u0026rsquo;s life and accomplishments, I tried to think of ways to make going to school and learning less traumatic. I had no idea why I thought going to a new school after mom had died would make a difference. Even a school with such amazing test results and college placement numbers.\u0026nbsp;\nI was tired of being picked on just for being smart. But maybe being smart could help me stop the other kids from poking fun at me. Maybe what I needed was a cover, a different personality to show the world. A shield to protect myself with. Maybe what I needed was a disguise, like Salvador Dali claimed he had given his Ocelot.\nAfter all, I had other talents. I had a black belt and piles of trophies from all the tournaments I\u0026rsquo;d been to through my dojo. I could be every bit the jock as the popular kids\u0026hellip;\nChapter 1\n"

	"content": "-2-\nTal\u0026rsquo;s running stopped half a block from the alley. His mind was torn, trying to force him to keep running, to get away as fast as possible but at the same time, he knew that running would attract attention. Attention was not his friend at the moment, so he forced his primal instincts to the back of his brain and focused on working the problem. Raising his wrist, he pulled up the holographic interface for his computer, hoping to plot a course to somewhere that would allow him to get off the moon without getting captured and hauled in for questioning, and an inevitable death by nanite assassins two weeks hence.\nA few quick manipulations of the hard light interface told him exactly where he was. What he needed was a clear idea of where he should be headed. The obvious way off the moon was via Tranquility\u0026rsquo;s spaceport or the shipyards where cargo entered the city from all over the solar system. However, those areas would also be heavily patrolled and the first places that the authorities would look for him once they were in pursuit, assuming they weren\u0026rsquo;t already. Fortunately, his father\u0026rsquo;s work on the shipyard docks meant that the family had a few friends and connections there. People who could probably tell him other ways to get away undetected.\nSwitching to his contacts, he pulled up the contact card for Bill Schwimmer, a co-worker of his father and a friend who had been over a few times a week for as long as Tal could remember. The man was gruff, outspoken against the Conglomerate regime, and knowledgeable about Tranquility in the same way as any diligent public servant would be. Pressing the call button, he slipped his comm link into his ear and tried not to jump for joy when Bill\u0026rsquo;s face appeared on his display. \u0026ldquo;Mr. Schwimmer, thank goodness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tal, what\u0026rsquo;s up, kiddo?\u0026rdquo; Bill\u0026rsquo;s dark features curled into a happy grin at the sight of Tal on the other end of the connection.\n\u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m in trouble, Mr. Schwimmer. Aegis Online is after me. I have something they want and if I don\u0026rsquo;t get it out of Tranquility soon, I\u0026rsquo;ll probably be dead before I get another chance at it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell have you got into, Tal?\u0026rdquo; Bill\u0026rsquo;s smile vanished and he started trying to look over Tal\u0026rsquo;s shoulder via the video link.\n\u0026ldquo;I \u0026mdash; \u0026rdquo; Tal tried to think of a way to explain the situation, but words failed him utterly. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. All I know is I need to get to the Dregs as soon as possible, and I was hoping you could tell me how to make it happen without getting picked up by the Conglom.\u0026rdquo;\nBill shook his head, running thick, calloused fingers through his short-cropped, black hair. \u0026ldquo;Tal, if you\u0026rsquo;re in trouble, you are endangering me and my family just by calling us. They\u0026rsquo;re going to track this call.\u0026rdquo;\nTracking. Crap. They had a dozen ways to track him without him being stupid. He needed to take care of a few things. Looking around the street, he spied another alley and started heading that direction, keeping an eye on pedestrians and traffic as he tried to keep the conversation going. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Mr. Schwimmer. I\u0026rsquo;ll let you go. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to get anyone in trouble.\u0026rdquo; He put on his best \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry\u0026rdquo; look as he spoke, laying on the puppy eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Dammit,\u0026rdquo; Bill spat, sighing in resignation. \u0026ldquo;All right, look. There are smuggler\u0026rsquo;s dens all around the rim of the crater. Look for a dive bar as close to the wall as you can find. There are lots of old and private hangars scattered around the rim as well, so people can use them to come and go with minimal interference from the Conglom. Try the North endow the city, you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t have much trouble finding a pilot with a ship and a lack of scruples out there. Convincing them to take you with them might be a problem though.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Mr. Schwimmer. Sorry to involve you in this.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry, kiddo. But when they contact me, I\u0026rsquo;m going to tell them I told you off and never to call me again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess that\u0026rsquo;s fair,\u0026rdquo; Tal tried not to let the tears of painful realization slip from his eyes. His life was quickly moving out of his control and every single comfort he\u0026rsquo;d ever known was evaporating like water in vacuum.\n\u0026ldquo;What should I tell your folks?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Tell them I love them, and that I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it. I\u0026rsquo;m going to get this sorted out and then I\u0026rsquo;ll be able to see them again.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you,\u0026rdquo; a tear slipped past his defenses despite his Herculean efforts to prevent it.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t sweat it. Be careful, Tal. And don\u0026rsquo;t call me again until whatever this is is over and done with.\u0026rdquo;\nThe line went dead an instant later and another tear streaked down Tal\u0026rsquo;s face as it did so. \u0026ldquo;No time for that,\u0026rdquo; he croaked, pulling a spare data crystal from his pocket and jamming it into his wrist computer. He was across the street and mere feet from the alley, so his time was limited. He had to start taking steps to prevent being tracked before he could escape.\nModern electronics were more amazing than any layperson on the street truly realized. Less than a century ago, he could have just shut the device off, or pulled out the batteries. But now, with the advent of vacuum power cells and ubiquitous network coverage, there was no way to truly shut off a consumer computer. Most people didn\u0026rsquo;t even realize that when they turned off their devices, they weren\u0026rsquo;t truly off. They were just in low power mode so they wouldn\u0026rsquo;t make noise and couldn\u0026rsquo;t be used. But they were still on. Still connected. Unlimited power meant there was no need to conserve battery power, and no need to make the power cells removable or replaceable. Hence, any off-the-shelf computer could be located at any time, whether it was on or not. And once a person set up a device for personal use, it became a beacon to their location, no matter where they were in Conglomerate facilities or ships.\nHe had to get rid of it if he wanted to disappear, but he needed to save not only his personal data, but the recording he\u0026rsquo;d made of what had happened in the alley as well. A few swipes and taps had his computer data, preferences, and the video \u0026mdash; his only evidence of what had happened \u0026mdash; copied to the crystal, which he removed from the computer and pocketed, then pulled the device from his wrist and scanned the street.\nEyeing a garbage vehicle leaving the alley, Tal turned down the narrow corridor and, as casually as possible, tossed his computer in the back of the vehicle as it passed him on its way back out into the street. He had no idea how long it would take them to track the device down, but he needed to get some other stuff done in order to cover his escape before they found his computer and retraced the vehicle\u0026rsquo;s route. The next bit, he wasn\u0026rsquo;t looking forward to.\nDodging around a corner into a shadowed alcove, Tal pulled a little pen knife from his pocket and clicked the narrow blade open. Clenching the implement between his teeth, he pulled off his shirt and tossed it over his shoulder, retrieving the knife and holding up his right hand, fingers spread wide. Angling it so that it caught a shaft of light from the rest of the alley, Tal squinted, trying to detect the little bio-chip beneath the surface of his skin. It was tiny. Smaller than a grain of rice. It linked him to his identity, his money, his family, everything in the world that was tracked by the computers of the Conglomerate. And it could give him away in an instant if he passed too close to a scanner, walked through a doorway, got on a bus or a train, or a thousand other everyday activities.\nIn short, it had to go.\nWincing as the blade bit into his flesh, it occurred to him that, had he listened to his parents and just gone down to the docks for work, he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to be digging a computer chip out of his hand after calling a family friend who worked the docks to find out how to get off the moon, away from the very corporation that he had forsaken work on the docks to try and make a future with. Nothing like a bit of gallows humor to lighten the mood while performing surgery on oneself.\n\u0026ldquo;Ha!\u0026rdquo; he almost shouted when he felt the little chip between his bloodied fingers and extracted it from the bleeding wound across the back of his hand. Tossing the thing to the ground, he crushed it with the heel of his shoe, then tore a strip off his bloodied shirt to wrap around his bleeding hand a few times. Wiping the blood from his pen knife, he closed it and shoved it back into his pocket, before retrieving his cross-country shirt from his book bag and pulled it on.\nRifling through the pockets on his bag, he pulled out the few odds and ends that were small enough to carry, and wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give him away to the authorities. A thin necklace with a little clay star dangling from it that his sister had given him for his birthday, a nice multi-tool his dad had given him when he turned fifteen, and a handful of data crystals. The rest went into a nearby dumpster, bag and all, before he set off down the alley at a trot, putting as much distance as possible between himself and the discarded personal items as fast as he could. Finally, he slowed to a casual walk and turned onto the sidewalk once more, heading north toward the crater\u0026rsquo;s wall.\nA few miles later, Tal stopped at a public computer kiosk and quickly scanned the news to see if anything about the incident had come up in the last hour. What he saw when he opened the news feed was something more of a shock than he was expecting.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, hell!\u0026rdquo; he spat, looking at the computer displays floating in the air around him. His heart sank when he saw a picture of him, on the ground, with the stranger slumped against his back and two dead Aegis Online security guards sprawled around them, pools of blood thick and scarlet on the ground beneath their bodies.\nHe could smell the coppery tang of the blood still, just looking at the image. Although it was probably enhanced by the tang of his own blood soaked into his torn shirt from the wound on his hand. Looking down farther in the alert, he saw that they had his name listed, plain as day. The headline read, \u0026ldquo;Troubled teen turned down for internship for scholastic reasons by Aegis Online, goes on rampage, killing three and wounding one. Still at large.\u0026rdquo;\nA rising sense of anger began to creep into his awareness, as he closed down the computer displays and headed off again, trying to put more distance between himself and the electronic targets that had once connected him to the world. The bastards were lying as boldly as if they ran the whole world and no one could ever challenge them. Academic reasons? He had better grades than most of the engineered kids in his school. Killing people? At worst, he was guilty of battery, but the video he\u0026rsquo;d recorded would likely prove to anyone that he acted rightly under the circumstances.\nWhat he needed to do was get the evidence to someone who could do something about his situation. After making copies to set aside for when the inevitable betrayal came around. If he had the ability to leverage whomever he eventually dealt with, they would be much more likely to stick to an agreed-upon resolution. If their news release was anything to go on, it didn\u0026rsquo;t look like trust was a concept he could rely on ever again. He\u0026rsquo;d been betrayed by everyone he\u0026rsquo;d met in the past hour and it had cost him his career, his future, and his family already.\nClearly, he would have to rethink his policies on interpersonal relations going forward.\nWithout his communications equipment, he had no ready means to access information, connect with people, or find out if his family was safe. He had no idea how to get out of the trouble he suddenly found himself in. He had no access to any of his money, what little of it he had in his account, without his electronics, or his ID chip at the point of sale. All he had were the few things on him, most of which had little or no intrinsic value, and Bill\u0026rsquo;s suggestion that he look for dive bars along the North rim of the city to go on.\nThoughts of all the places he could be caught, all the ways he could be tracked, and all the horrible things Aegis Online would do to him if they caught him, whirled through his mind like a sickening miasma of terrible dreams, chipping away at his confidence. He tried to think of some way, any way, that he could get clear of the situation, but that just led to him thinking about how the unknown number of killer robots swimming around in his veins were just as likely to end his journey as any run-in with the Conglomerate.\nIf he went to the authorities and tried to explain himself, he might get lucky about the mess in the alley, although that seemed unlikely, but the nanites were a death sentence that he wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure just anyone could handle for him. He might get the one person in a hundred that had the best interest of a citizen in mind, rather than some corporate agenda, or their own personal climb up the social ladder. Sure, they could be trusted to stop Dissident threats or put out fires. They even caught the occasional thief or other minor criminal. But a cop-killing teenager? The majority of them probably wouldn\u0026rsquo;t give it a second thought before beating him to the point that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t speak, then feeding him to the court of public opinion. Everyone loved to see a Dissident get what was coming to them on the net. He knew, because until just an hour ago, he had loved it too. Now, he was Dissident scum.\nHe needed a plan. Being on the run, however, was something of a new experience for him. He didn\u0026rsquo;t know the first thing about surviving off the grid. A grid that was so extensive that it updated a person\u0026rsquo;s medical records every time they used the toilet. No computer. No communication. No money. No knowledge of the situation. No hope.\nHe needed help.\nTaking another random turn, perhaps his fifth or sixth since he\u0026rsquo;d used the public computer kiosk, his hand drifted to his pocket and dipped inside. The hard edges of two little storage crystals touched his fingertips and he picked them up, rolling them over in his hand thoughtfully, as he considered his precious few options. Romeo seemed to be his only real option. He\u0026rsquo;d seen documentaries about killer nanites and how they worked. There were hundreds of varieties, all of which were highly illegal, of course, but they all had one thing in common. They were almost impossible to defeat before they fulfilled their mission, or were properly deactivated by some external control. They were tamper resistant, fault tolerant, potentially self replicating, hardened against EMP attacks, and usually programmed to destroy their host in the event that they were tampered with anyway.\nSo, if Horatio meant what he said, then Romeo had whatever device was necessary to deactivate the nanites. Which meant Romeo was his first and best bet to surviving long enough to try to get clear of this mess. But Romeo was on Ceres, and Tal had no way to get there. No legitimate ship went from Conglomerate space to Ceres. That was Dissident territory. A no-man\u0026rsquo;s land that no law-abiding citizen would dare attempt to access. The Conglomerate didn\u0026rsquo;t even officially acknowledge that there were people there, even though it was all but common knowledge that was were the Dissidents lived. Every attempt was made to dissuade discussion of the planetoid and its inhabitants even now that Earth had been opened back up to colonization and the Conglomerate was quickly losing political power to the new government.\nTal\u0026rsquo;s thoughts continued to meander as he kept moving, picking his way along the road, making the occasional random turn and even doubling back on his path once or twice, all the while headed north toward the rim. His runner\u0026rsquo;s body was used to the motion of muscles, putting one foot in front of the other over and over, then beating out a cadence against the ground and carrying him ever forward. They had a motto on his cross-country team: \u0026ldquo;No way out but through.\u0026rdquo; The motto echoed in his mind as he crossed ten, then fifteen miles from where he\u0026rsquo;d started his escape. His body barely registered the exertion at a walking pace.\nThe buildings grew shorter as he continued northward, the blue sky fading away to reveal the structure of the dome that held it in, as it arched closer and closer to the crater wall that was the edge of the enclosed city. The day rolled on into night and the street lights struggled to compensate, either from years of disrepair that far out in the slums, or from intentional sabotage done to keep the streets as dark as possible for the doing of misdeeds with minimal interruptions. Bill\u0026rsquo;s voice echoed in his head: Look for dive bars near old hangars.\nPressing forward into the growing darkness, Tal\u0026rsquo;s thoughts were interrupted by the far-off sound of singing. It was a chorus of perhaps half a dozen voices, with no apparent instrumental accompaniment, save for a single, resonating drum, pounding out a staccato to underpin the melody. They blended together so completely though, that he couldn\u0026rsquo;t really tell how many there were, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t help but move toward the sound to try to find out.\nEssequibo River is the king of rivers all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo River is the king of rivers all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nIt was a lilting alto voice, probably female, that sung the leading lines, and was quickly followed up by the chorus of other perfectly attuned voices for the chorus. Moving toward the music, Tal came into sight of a smallish building, nestled between two larger structures that loomed over it like thugs waiting to steal its lunch money.\nEssequibo captain is the king of captains all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo captain is the king of captains all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nMoving closer, he could hear the dull murmur of conversation underpinning the narrative of the song, but it was evident that the singers, whoever they were, were commanding the majority of the people in the building. A building which, as he drew nearer, identified itself as\u0026nbsp; Leonidas\u0026rsquo;s Last Stand, via a flickering, faded holographic sign over its one crooked door.\nEssequibo sailor is the king of sailors all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo sailor is the king of sailors all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nMoving up to the door, Tal pulled the hinged panel open a bit, taking a moment to fully appreciate the reality of a hinged, manual door in the middle of one of the most technologically advanced cities in the system. He then peeked through the gap into the building\u0026rsquo;s interior. The light inside was muted and warm, with a few bright spots of harsh white light thrown on a stage made of what appeared to be old shipping containers in one corner of the room. There were close to one hundred people in the large room, all sitting around tables, nursing drinks, and watching the figures on the stage, a dull rumble of occasional conversations rippling through them every once in awhile.\nEssequibo bosun is the king of bosuns all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo bosun is the king of bosuns all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nThe room smelled of long-ago spilled beer and the freshly sour sweat of hard labor, mixed with the overbearing odor of greasy food cooked short-order style on a screaming hot, flat griddle. Adding to the assault on his sense of smell was the overpowering stench of some cheap deodorizing agent that heaped its own stink atop the other olfactory assaults, rather than offsetting any of them.\nOn the stage, which appeared to be quite solid and well-used, despite its make-shift construction, was a group of four people, three women and one man, singing with what looked like absolute passion for their endeavor. The four of them belted out each chord with perfect harmony, as the man attacked the drum using little more than his fingertips. The music they made filled the room to overflowing with warmth and energy that suffused the space like a security blanket and made everything feel just a little bit better in Tal\u0026rsquo;s mind.\nEssequibo Judy is the queen of Judies all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo Judy is the queen of Judies all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nTal drew himself through the door, standing just inside and watching the performance, which despite the attractiveness of all four singers, had little to do with dancing, or any other visual art. They simply captivated nearly every person in the room with the power of their song, drawing them in and holding them prisoner in a cell made of aural love and the sweaty odor of hard work being swept away by drinks, food, and music.\nEssequibo River is the king of rivers all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nEssequibo River is the king of rivers all,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nLooking around as the music washed over him, Tal saw that the low murmurs he was hearing were coming from the corners of the room, where people were quietly conducting business under the veil of privacy that the music afforded them. The room\u0026rsquo;s population was not exactly what he was expecting though. Rather than the burly, hardened, road-weary, thug-like individuals that the buildings flanking the bar resembled, the place was filled with, for the most part, regular folks. Sure, most of them looked a little tougher or a little wiser than an average person in the city might, but there was the same variety of faces, genders, heights, weights, and more. There were some people with tattoos and some without, and some with genetic or cybernetic modifications, and some without. In short, it was just a regular place of business, with regular people in it.\nSomebody, oh, Johnny, somebody, oh,\nBuddy ta-na-na, we are somebody, oh.\nWhen the song stopped and the singers\u0026rsquo; total control of those paying attention to them began to ebb away, the entire room slowly turned to look toward the door and the new person standing there.\nThey all turned to look at Tal.\n"

Cargo\u0026rsquo;s loaded and secured, and the ship is clear. We should have been skids-up ten minutes ago!\u0026rdquo;\n-Refueling is taking longer than your timetable allowed, Miss Torres. Our exit from Hygea burned nearly half of our fuel and two of the four JATO rockets.-\n\u0026ldquo;Are you insinuating that the delay is my fault for playing around?\u0026rdquo;\n-No, Miss Torres. It was not my intention to insinuate anything. I am telling you that the delay is your doing.-\n\u0026ldquo;Way to go with the subtlety there, super-genius.\u0026rdquo; She rolled her eyes.\n-It isn\u0026rsquo;t my duty to be subtle, Miss Torres. It is my duty to assist you in the completion of your duties, and in the maintaining of your well-being. Your parents built a business based upon their ability to be serious when necessary, which always seemed to include any time during which they were carrying someone else\u0026rsquo;s property, and by ensuring that their timetables were properly padded where possible to insure they could complete tasks within quoted timeframes. Your stunt cost us time, and you money. Ergo, my comment.-\nShe nearly bit off her tongue restraining herself from snarling back to the computer. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t argue his point though. Even inasmuch as she truly wanted to.\n\u0026ldquo;How much longer are we talking?\u0026rdquo; She did her best to not look put out as she leaned against the wall of the cargo hold, gazing down the ramp into the huge landing bay of Io station.\nIt was a truly impressive sight: a cavernous space with a few dozen large doors on either side. Each of the doors permitted access to ship-sized airlocks that vessels could enter and exit the station through. But more impressive were the mind-bogglingly complex and heavy-weight series of gantries, rails, articulated arms, and moving platforms that criss-crossed the space. The array of machinery allowed a vessel to land in a small, private airlock, then be transferred into the massive internal space. Once inside, they could be stacked wingtip to wingtip by computer-controlled manipulators, using every iota of space inside the cavernous station.\nThe design allowed vessels to be packed into the space, stacked two and three deep and one atop the next so that the ground crews could service them more efficiently than if they were in individual hangers, or on separate landing pads like so many other facilities in the Sol system. It also made for an impressive diversion for Rayne\u0026rsquo;s attention as she tried not to think about the delay in her schedule.\nTechnically, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t on any sort of official timetable, but in an effort to establish a name for herself, she had laid out her own personal itinerary to keep her on track and ensure delivery of her cargo in a timely fashion. And at that point, she was already almost twenty minutes behind, not counting the time it would take for the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity to be hauled out to an available air lock after refueling.\nAs she mulled over her deteriorating plans and tried to look unimpressed by the elaborate ballet of mechanical platforms, robotic arms, and moving vessels around her, she caught sight of a person looking her way from a nearby hatch. Shifting her focus, she keyed in on the figure to try to discern some distinguishing feature, or even just confirm that the person was indeed looking at her, or was it her ship? The latter was confirmed. Upon noticing her attention, the figure fixed a steady gaze on her, then looked at her cargo, strapped down to the deck of her hold, and quickly flipped up an oversized coat collar as they turned, slipping through the hatchway. She quirked a violet eyebrow at the action as Jarvis responded.\n-At present rate of refueling, ten more minutes, plus five for buttoning up.-\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she said. \u0026ldquo;Start buttoning her up now. I\u0026rsquo;m going to go check on something before we go.\u0026rdquo;\n-Very well.- The moment her feet cleared the edge, the cargo ramp began swinging upward.\nShe trotted off the Serendipity\u0026rsquo;s pad, cutting across the narrow gantry a dozen paces before she could turn toward the hatchway in question, then jogged the hundred or so yards to where she\u0026rsquo;d seen the figure standing. Slipping through the hatchway, she found a flight of stairs that led up to a higher gantry for the next row of ships. She mounted the stairs three at a time, careful to keep her footfalls as quiet as possible. At the top of the stairs she came to another hatchway, through which she found the upper gantry spreading out away from her. The mysterious person was nowhere to be seen in the small groups of people there.\nCasting her gaze around, she saw numerous station personnel. Techs working on ships or hauling gear. Computer-controlled lifters moving cargo to and from waiting vessels. Ship crews using the pedestrian gantries to access the portals that would give them access to the station proper. But nowhere did she see the \u0026ndash; suddenly, she did. The figure was a dozen yards away, just emerging from behind a pallet of crates and quickly walking toward the living area of the station.\nHustling behind the body, Rayne dodged around a couple of techs and shouted after the person.\n\u0026ldquo;Hey! What are you looking for? Why are you watching my ship?\u0026rdquo; she called.\nThe figure kept moving, pretending not to hear her words, or at least not aware that she was addressing him or her \u0026ndash; she could not tell the gender. Although she suspected it was a man from the gait they were keeping.\nPouring on the speed, Rayne slipped through and around the people on the gantry, as she had learned to do growing up in such places. In her haste to catch up to them, however, caught her toe on a moving crate and, when she was an arm\u0026rsquo;s length from the person, staggered forward, slamming her hand into their shoulder. They both tumbled forward, the person in front of her landing on the gantry railing with a noisy grunt and a thud. The high collar and decidedly outdated fedora managed to somehow stay in place as the stranger listed, recovering his or her feet with a fluid grace and then spinning to face her.\nIt was a man, she could see that now that they were facing one another. \u0026ldquo;Hey! I\u0026rsquo;m talking to you!\u0026rdquo; she growled, recovering her balance and deciding it would be better to play out the scene as if she had meant to knock him over. It was likely one of those things that would look bad in hindsight, but in the heat of the moment, and with her mind reeling from the incident, she needed to keep her tough act up, or break down as an alternative.\nThe stranger\u0026rsquo;s reaction was instant. He spun around on his heels, turning to face her with military precision. She caught sight of the gun, as it emerged from the dark interior of the whirling jacket, and her years of practicing martial arts with her mother kicked in. Stepping forward and turning into her opponent\u0026rsquo;s body, she trapped the gun with her left hand as she raised her right arm, stabbing at his head with her elbow.\nThe man dodged under her attack, but just barely. Her elbow caught the brim of the old brown hat, tipping it off his head and revealing the rather handsome features of the person beneath. His dark eyes were locked on hers and his equally dark hair was perfectly trimmed in a sort of pseudo-military, no-nonsense, easy-maintenance style that made the whole of him a rather striking image to behold.\n\u0026ldquo;Nice hat,\u0026rdquo; she said, piling on the sarcasm.\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks,\u0026rdquo; he responded with a smooth tenor.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s brave of you to go out spying in it. Very classic cloak-and-dagger,\u0026rdquo; she poured it on.\n\u0026ldquo;If I was spying, you\u0026rsquo;d never have seen me. I\u0026rsquo;m just a concerned citizen,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Like hell you are,\u0026rdquo; she frowned, trying not to get lost in his dark eyes and silky voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Gun!\u0026rdquo; someone shouted from nearby and in an instant, the entire landing bay changed tone. The working people dove face-first to the deck, lying on the various gantries, landing pads, and stairs. The crews and passengers from other docked vessels looked around in surprise, trying to find the source of the disturbance. Some of them apparently knew the routine and either hit the deck themselves or drew weapons of their own, as if preparing for a war.\nRayne\u0026rsquo;s moment of inspection and the sudden change in atmosphere cost her, as the man twisted beneath her raised elbow and tugged at his trapped weapon. But her grip held, and as she refocused her mind, she moved into his stance again.\n\u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mon. Don\u0026rsquo;t be like this. I just want to know why you\u0026rsquo;re checking out my cargo!\u0026rdquo; she bit off at him, twisting the handgun against his grip to pull it free and drop it to the ground.\nWith a grunt, he released the weapon, yanked his arm away, and somersaulted past her. Popping up to his feet and without a moment\u0026rsquo;s hesitation. In his hand a short double-edged knife had appeared.\n\u0026ldquo;Really?\u0026rdquo; She quirked an eyebrow at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry, instinct,\u0026rdquo; he responded, eyes drifting to the blade for just a second, then sweeping over the gantry between them, passing over his gun before coming to rest on her. \u0026ldquo;I guess we can do it the old fashioned way, if you want.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not looking for a fight,\u0026rdquo; Rayne held her hands up.\n\u0026ldquo;Then why\u0026rsquo;d you hit me?\u0026rdquo; The knife vanished back beneath his coat, but his stance didn\u0026rsquo;t relax any as he spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;It was an accident,\u0026rdquo; Raynes cheeks burned with embarrassment at the admission. \u0026ldquo;I was just trying to figure out why you were so interested in my cargo.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe I was just checking you out,\u0026rdquo; he smirked.\n\u0026ldquo;I know the difference,\u0026rdquo; she rolled her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure you do,\u0026rdquo; he responded, reaching for his gun.\nRayne snaked her foot out ahead of his hand though, trapping the weapon under her boot and pulling it away from his grasp.\n\u0026ldquo;I thought you weren\u0026rsquo;t looking for a fight,\u0026rdquo; He looked up at her doubtfully.\n\u0026ldquo;That doesn\u0026rsquo;t mean I want to get shot in the back. Or the front. Or anywhere else, for that matter,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;Then stop that,\u0026rdquo; he reached for the gun again, but she dragged it further from him.\nGrinning at him, she said, \u0026ldquo;not until you tell me what you\u0026rsquo;re up to.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; he nodded, lurching forward and upward from his low crouch. His hands pressed into her stomach and his strength and leverage lifted her off the gantry, pushing her back with significant force.\nAs she felt herself being forced away from him, she threw her arms over her head, arching her back and planting her hands on the gantry behind her, swinging her legs up off the ground and striking him in the torso with her feet and knocking his fedora off his head before completing the handspring and finding her balance again.\nThe man staggered away from her under the force of the blow, but quickly regained his balance and in seconds they were on one another again, the gun being kicked between them like a hockey puck as they traded punches and elbows, each blocking the other\u0026rsquo;s attacks more often than not.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re good, I\u0026rsquo;ll grant you that,\u0026rdquo; he announced, kicking her foot away from his gun and stomping his foot down on the bottom of the handle, causing the weapon to hop up into the air.\nRayne saw the movement and looped her own toe under the falling gun, then hoisted it up into the air further and saying, \u0026ldquo;thank you. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked hard to become so.\u0026rdquo;\nHis hand snaked out and grabbed the gun now that it was near the level of their waists, but Rayne lifted her leg again, striking the underside of his hand with the top of her knee and knocking the gun out of his hand and further into the air.\nNarrowing his eyes at her, his other hand snaked out to grab the gun, but Rayne pushed a foot into his stomach with a slower-than-usual side kick, meant more to keep him at bay than to harm him. With her right hand, she caught his gun out of the air and locked her eyes on him as she felt his fingers wrap around her booted foot.\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; he growled, giving her foot a harsh twist and a hard yank. Her loosely-tied boot came off as her body went face-first into the gantry with a heavy thud. Shaking his head, he tossed her boot over the rail then vaulted over the edge himself.\n\u0026ldquo;Holy crap!\u0026rdquo; she shouted, crawling to the edge of the walkway and looking under the railing to watch him land on the gantry near the Serendipity, tuck into another somersault to absorb the force of the landing, and come up at a dead run toward the station proper.\nRayne took a moment to inspect the weapon, still in her hand, as she listened to his footsteps. It was a standard ten millimeter auto-pistol. Caseless, with an electronic firing mechanism and a series of hash marks, in groups of five, running down the exterior of the slide on the left side. Nothing fancy, but obviously the marks had some sort of meaning, as they were all the same length and the same distance apart, save for the one diagonal hash mark that crossed each group of four vertical lines.\nPulling herself to her feet, she hobbled on her one shoe over to the fallen hat, stooping to pick up the old brown thing, she looked over the rail again to see the man glaring up at her from a half-closed door that she recognized as heading into the habitable area of the station. Once he was through there, he would disappear into the crowd and she\u0026rsquo;d never find him. Their eyes met once more, and he gave her a curt nod before shouting up at her in a clear tenor voice, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll be back for those.\u0026rdquo;\nThen the door closed, cutting him off from any pursuit she might care to give.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll never see me \u0026ndash; or your peashooter again,\u0026rdquo; she answered him under her breath, looking down to the objects in her hands.\nExamining the inside of the hat, she found its satin lining in perfect condition and its felted exterior was obviously old, but well cared for.\n\u0026ldquo;Although \u0026ndash; \u0026rdquo; she grinned, as she pinched the indentations in the front of the hat between her fingers and slipped it onto her head. It fit perfectly, and she felt a rush of childish mirth and deviousness roll through her \u0026ndash; the same feeling she used to get whenever she did something that she knew she shouldn\u0026rsquo;t do, and knew she\u0026rsquo;d be caught doing.\nShe finished her thought. \u0026ldquo;I think that maybe on the right person, this could seriously work.\u0026rdquo;\nTurning back toward the stairway, she took another look at her captured weapon. It, too, seemed older than she suspected at first glance but was also exceptionally well cared for. Ejecting the magazine, she slid it into her own pocket, then racked the slide, locking it open and inspecting the firing mechanism. It too, was extremely well cared-for.\nLooking back toward the closed hatch he\u0026rsquo;d disappeared through, she shook her head. As the local security force trotted up to her, she held up her hands, the gun hanging on her finger by its trigger guard to show it was both unloaded, and that she did not intend to resist them. The questioning lasted only a few minutes, during which time she answered them dutifully.\nYes, \u0026nbsp;she\u0026rsquo;d started it, but it was a mistake. No, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t a terrorist trying to blow up the station. Yes, she knew the rules and understood she could be fined. She left out the bit about him drawing the gun and told them it had fallen from his person during their altercation and that she would very much like to return it to him, since everything else was technically legal. When asked, she showed them the magazine from her pocket, with its little oxygen-impregnated shaped-explosive caseless rounds. They were legal, frangible rounds. The kind that turned to metal dust upon impact with hard surfaces, instead of punching through them.\nThe security people went on to ask her fifty more questions about the situation before finally relenting. They couldn\u0026rsquo;t do much more than detain her for a while anyway, and they no doubt had more pressing matters to attend to than a non-brawl on the hangar deck.\n\u0026ldquo;Who the hell are you?\u0026rdquo; she breathed, looking at the door the man had disappeared behind as the security people moved off and the landing bay began to return to its former buzz of activity around her.\n-The authorities have cleared us for launch,- Jarvis announced, as Rayne closed the side airlock behind her.\n\u0026ldquo;Was there some kind of doubt that they would?\u0026rdquo; She raised an eyebrow at the nearest of Jarvis\u0026rsquo;s optical sensors.\n-There was an altercation involving a firearm,- he responded. -You managed to stop deck operations for nearly five minutes.-\n\u0026ldquo;And?\u0026rdquo; she dared him.\n-Yes, Miss Torres. There was some doubt. However, since the weapon was not fired and no one appears to have been hurt, they are clearing us for departure.-\n\u0026ldquo;How nice of them,\u0026rdquo; she groaned, as she stepped up to the locker in her cabin and pulled the door open. The Serendipity shook, and the automated platforms and manipulators began to haul her toward the nearest available lock. Rayne barely noticed the disturbance; having grown up aboard the vessel meant that her \u0026ldquo;sea legs\u0026rdquo; were as solid as the best career spacers out there. Instead, she merely ejected the magazine from her mysterious watcher\u0026rsquo;s weapon, cleared the chamber, and set the weapon and magazine in their appropriate places in her locker\u0026rsquo;s gun rack, next to her own handguns and the other gift her father had given her the day she left Hygea.\nThe boltcaster\u0026rsquo;s dull shine did little to detract from the truth of the weapon\u0026rsquo;s capabilities. He had handed it to her with a stern look, then pressed a small case filled with ammunition and a holster inside into her hands. She still remembered the seriousness of his words as he\u0026rsquo;d done so.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s a dangerous solar system out there, Rayne, he had said. I hope you never use this, but I\u0026rsquo;d prefer you have it and not need it.\nPicking up the weapon from its cradle, she hefted its weight, slight though it was to her cybernetic strength \u0026ndash; the same strength that had doubtless led to her accosting a stranger on Io station. Its relatively compact frame was less than a foot in length, with a comfortable hand grip and utilitarian design. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t much more than a linear accelerator, a trigger, and a catch that released the breach for loading, but its nearly three-inch-wide barrel added a level of menace that few other weapons of its size could muster. Running her fingers along the barrel, she clicked the breach release, and her eyes widened in surprise at the crisp action as the barrel tilted forward, revealing the rear stops that would cradle the shell once inserted.\nShe\u0026rsquo;d seen her father use the weapon a few times, usually with simple, solid projectiles or scatter loads, but at the back of the shelf, plugged into the ship\u0026rsquo;s power to maintain the relatively delicate containment fields within, she could see the outline of the half dozen anti-matter rounds she had discovered in the case. Those, she knew, were a thousand times more dangerous than what the Conglomerate feared someone might do with an armor-piercing bullet. If she was ever caught with that kind of ammunition aboard a public facility, she would probably be shot without hesitation.\nAnother rocking motion shook her out of her thoughts, and she had the weapon closed up and put back into the locker before Jarvis announced over the ship\u0026rsquo;s intercom, -We\u0026rsquo;re ready for launch, Miss. Torres. The airlock is cycling us out now.-\n\u0026ldquo;Thanks, Jarvis,\u0026rdquo; she nodded to the empty room. \u0026ldquo;Cycle up the engines for me please. I\u0026rsquo;ll be right there.\u0026rdquo;\n-Compliance.-\nRolling her eyes at the ship\u0026rsquo;s computer, she unzipped her jumpsuit and shrugged out of the upper half again, tying the sleeves around her waist, as she made her way to the bridge. Already, her first job had proven to be more interesting than she would have expected, but gunfights with crazy strangers who had questionable fashion sense aside, she was confident that the worst she\u0026rsquo;d have to contend with going forward was a snarky AI.\nSighing happily as the conforming material of the acceleration seat gripped her body, she turned to face the controls, grinning like the Cheshire Cat at the vast, open starfield revealed through the opening doors in front of her ship. She stretched out in her chair and leaned her head back, sinking into an optimistic confidence, oblivious to the tiny, flickering warning on the right side of the main console.\nAn unfamiliar ship was falling in behind her, its sensor image fading out under the effects of some kind of cloak.\n-Miss Torres,- Jarvis announced, highlighting the spot where the unknown vessel had disappeared in her sensors. -I think we may have an issue.-\n"

	"content": "-1- Darren sighed as he made the ODN connection to the computer and started the file transfer. The job was easy enough really. Break in, grab the files off the computer, delete the source, and drop the virus to wipe out the rest of the system. Root the whole thing and overwrite the master boot records on the storage drives. It was standard smash-and-grab fare with minimal danger and no resistance.\nThe target, a high level officer within the same company Darren worked for as a Pincher, had grabbed data to hold over someone else as blackmail material or carve out their own little empire within the company. Like so many before, they\u0026rsquo;d been found out and Darren had been sent in to retrieve what they had stolen. He knew it was customary to send out a Hitter next, if it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been done already, to take care of the actual person, but Darren had long ago decided not to think about that part of the business world.\nHe was an industrial thief. A good one. Anything else his employer did was entirely their business and not for him to lose any sleep over. People died and went missing all the time, many of them due to corporate entanglements within their own organizations. Which is why he liked being a thief. He had to rely only on himself to get things done and he never put his life in the hands of another person. He made it a personal goal to never get involved in politics or corporate ladder climbing.\nA subtle tone from the computer embedded in his skull alerted him that the file copy was complete and he focused his attention back on the computer in front of him. Waving his hand in the air, he pulled up a holographic interface and navigated the storage drive inside his skull, locating a particularly nasty fire-and-forget virus he\u0026rsquo;d purchased from a hacker down near the core of the Venus Station a while back. Dropping the virus into the target\u0026rsquo;s computer, he popped the ODN cable out of the head jack behind his right ear, executing the program and smirking as the computer\u0026rsquo;s display matrix shuddered and sprayed a wash of color all over the office in a dazzling display of light before going dark.\n\u0026ldquo;And that, is all I have to say about that,\u0026rdquo; he whispered, pushing himself up out of the chair as he coiled up the cable and tucked it into a pocket.\nMaking his way to the office door, he shut off the lights and keyed the sliding panel open to slip out into the enveloping blackness of his target\u0026rsquo;s domicile. In short order, he was out the front door, stopping only to verify the pulse of the guard he\u0026rsquo;d waylaid on his way in was still strong.\nHe made it nearly a hundred yards from the home before the alarms started going off and the sounds of pursuit became evident. Taking a moment to glance around a corner, he saw three burly men heading his direction, weapons drawn and what looked like thermal head gear or cybernetic eyes in use to track his body heat.\n\u0026ldquo;Figures,\u0026rdquo; he mumbled as he slid his bast\u0026oacute;n from their sheath across his back and moved the metal alloy sticks into his hands.\nTaking cover behind a wall, he waited until the sound of their approach was on top of him before throwing himself into a cartwheel. As his feet arced through the air, the trio came into view, upside down from his perspective, mild surprise showing on their faces. His move was the unexpected part of the equation and that was exactly what he was counting on to make good his escape with a minimum of hassle and no loss of life.\nHis shin slammed into the leading thug\u0026rsquo;s forearm, dislodging his firearm and sending it skittering across the ground at their feet. They started to react as his feet found purchase on the ground once more and he brought his fighting sticks to bear on the second thug\u0026rsquo;s weapon, sending it into a high, spiraling arc that had it landing a dozen feet away with a clatter of metal on metal.\nTurning himself around with his back to the third man, he hooked his bast\u0026oacute;n around the necks of the disarmed men, pinching them between his fighting sticks and his forearms, then threw himself into a foreword roll, dragging them both forward with him. The sudden change in height as he tucked into his roll meant the shot fired by the third thug missed him, passing through the air where his head had been a fraction of a second earlier.\nFrom the ground, he clubbed the two prone figures before kicking up into a one-handed hand-spring as a second frangible bullet shattered on the metal deck where he had just been. Momentum allowed him to swing one foot forward to kick the third guy in the face and carried his weight all the way through until he found his feet once more, this time facing the final assailant.\nTo his credit, the man recovered quickly from the kick to his face. Aiming his weapon at Darren once more, he fired another shot that Darren avoided by twisting and ducking inside the shooter\u0026rsquo;s line of fire. Still, the bullet passed through the jacket between Darren\u0026rsquo;s body and inner arm, tearing a hole in the garment.\n\u0026ldquo;Dammit! I just bought that!\u0026rdquo; Darren grumbled as he pushed off the ground, hunching his back and driving it into the man\u0026rsquo;s chest with his genetically-enhanced legs. The effort picked them both up off the ground. As they arced through the air, Darren tucked his legs up over his head, rolling over backwards so that when they landed, his feet were on either side of the man\u0026rsquo;s head, looking down into the guy\u0026rsquo;s eyes as they darted about, searching for options.\n\u0026ldquo;Now I have to go shopping, and I hate going anywhere near the shipyards and the central shaft.\u0026rdquo; To punctuate his statement and demonstrate his displeasure, he brought down his right hand, fist still clenched around the alloy bast\u0026oacute;n, and punched the man in the head, knocking him unconscious.\n\u0026ldquo;I hate shopping,\u0026rdquo; he grunted, sliding his bast\u0026oacute;n home in their sheath as he hustled away from the scene and disappearing into the crowd of the nearest transit station.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ndash;Next Chapter\u0026ndash;\n"

	"content": "Riana had tried for quite a while to come up with some other word\u0026nbsp; or description to refute the obvious appearance of what was happening before her. But, as hard as she thought about it, not to mention the words of her mother about\u0026nbsp; her growing abilities, she\u0026rsquo;d just settled on using the word she kept trying to avoid: teleport. Simpler was so often better, and dealing with such esoteric concepts as point-to-point travel without actually traversing distance tended to break people\u0026rsquo;s minds. So using familiar, simple words seemed the way to go.\nOne of her mothers, Kilishandra, had explained what was happening as essentially sound science, then pulled an old literary quote out to describe it, saying something about sufficiently advanced science appearing as magic. Initially, Riana had used Kalijor as a sort of intermediary, crossing distances there, instead of the real world, and then shifting back into normal space in a new location. The time difference between Kalijor and the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; world made the travel seem extremely fast to those watching, even though she had to physically travel the distance in Kalijor, and spend the time it took to do so. But now, on a hunch that she was using Kalijor as a crutch, Riana pictured the secluded hallway outside the restrooms at Magoun\u0026rsquo;s bistro in her mind\u0026rsquo;s eye and simply nudged herself across the spatial gap between the Serendipity and the eatery.\nThe actual travel was not unpleasant, or even uncomfortable. Not at all like teleportation in Kalijor. There was almost no sensation, just a subtle movement of air that could easily be attributed to the change in temperature and humidity between the two locations. She was simply on the bridge with Vincent one instant, and standing in the hallway outside the restrooms of a local restaurant the next. No lurching, or squeezing, or darkness. No flashing lights or wild energy vortexes. She was just there. And in the next instant,\u0026nbsp; a poor young man bearing a large tray filled with dirty dishes toward the kitchen\u0026rsquo;s back entrance ran into her.\nTo his credit, he managed himself very well. He kept the tray as level as possible, even as he bounced off Riana\u0026rsquo;s deceptively lithe form and staggered backward in eminent danger of completely loosing his balance. The startled gasp that escaped his lips was not the sort of sound she would expect\u0026nbsp; from someone who had just run into a person that had not been there an instant before. Instead, it was a sort of quietly dignified sigh, as if to say \u0026lsquo;here we go again.\u0026rsquo;\nBringing her cybernetically enhanced body into motion, Riana acted with lightning speed. She took a step toward the reeling man, snaked an arm around his shoulders to arrest his fall, and snatched the precariously piled tray of soiled dishes from him with her free hand, stabilizing the platform with a subtle clacking of dishes and tinkling of silverware. Smiling at the waiter as she helped him back to his feet, she held onto the tray until he was composed enough to take it back from her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, Ma\u0026rsquo;am, I must have been in too much of a rush.\u0026rdquo; He tried to cover the incident by taking the blame.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s my fault,\u0026rdquo; Riana smiled, returning the tray to him. \u0026ldquo;I sort of came out of nowhere there.\u0026rdquo; As she handed the man his tray, she saw a glimmer of recognition in his eyes and preemptively shook her head, ears twitching. \u0026ldquo;Trust me, I\u0026rsquo;m not her. I\u0026rsquo;ve been getting no end of trouble since that crazy person started wreaking havoc all over the system. It seems we may have used the same Bio-Engineer\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana locked her violet eyes on the man and pleaded with every ounce of unspoken desperation she could muster.\nThe waiter looked at her for a long moment, then seemed to process what she had said and slowly nodded. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, that kinda sucks. Can I get you anything? Are you with someone?\u0026rdquo;\nBreathing a sigh of relief, Riana nodded. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;d like a plate of pierogies and smoked sausage with a glass of water. My guy will be along in a bit, he\u0026rsquo;s just battening down the hatches.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, have a seat wherever you like and I\u0026rsquo;ll be right back with your order,\u0026rdquo; he said, smiling, moving off into the back of the restaurant.\n\u0026ldquo;This is going to be a problem,\u0026rdquo; she whispered, watching him go. Casting her eyes around as she moved into the dining room, she watched as eyes darted away from her gaze, quickly turning to look anywhere but at her. Moving off to a corner booth, she slid into the barely-comfortable chair and turned her attention to the video screen on the table. Swiping through various channels, she was happy to learn that whatever was going on in Neo-Tokyo, it was at least no longer the news du jour. She had to search a bit to locate the feeds about the siege on the city.\nWhat she did find confirmed what she had been told back in Ceres. Anja had taken over the place. She\u0026rsquo;d made no attempts to conceal herself, and her almost completely identical appearance to Riana, in more\u0026nbsp; than just outward looks, insured that any scanner or other apparatus would identify her ~as~ Riana. So, pulling up footage of the other woman moving down main street Neo-Tokyo a few weeks past, shooting people indiscriminately, Riana realized that just having different colored hair, eyes, and a wholly different personality, wasn\u0026rsquo;t going to be enough to convince anyone that they were truly different people.\nShe needed a plan. Something to get them both in the same place, at the same time, and in front of the right people, to insure there was no doubt that there were indeed two of them, and that they were not both raging maniacs. Riana needed to know what Anja was after, and why it was so important that she was willing to turn the entire solar system against her to get it. It was the only hope of stopping her.\nShe turned away from the video footage of the Conglomerate military forces at the intersection of the northern ring and Neo-Tokyo. Splaying her fingers out on the table, she absently shifted her gaze back and forth between her left and right hands as her mind worked on the problem. Pulling up the security feed she\u0026rsquo;d copied form the Tranquility port authority before all the madness began, she looked over Anja\u0026rsquo;s face, her own face, really. The other woman\u0026rsquo;s icy blue eyes looked up at the camera from beneath her shock of dark blue hair and her lips curled into a knowing, challenging smile.\nAnja, it seemed, was Gregory Shantal, transformed by some unknown means into an almost exact replica of herself. He, or she, now, had used the similarities between them to wage a war across the Sol system and catapult Riana to the top of the most wanted list. She knew Riana would get out of the virtual prison she had locked her in, down in the depths of Ceres. She knew it, just as surely as she knew Riana would get ahold of the security footage from the port authority, and she had shared her little smile for just the two of them. Anja understood how Riana thought and was using that knowledge to keep her stumbling along in the wake of whatever grand plans she was orchestrating with her maniacal efforts.\nAs she thought, the waiter returned with her plate, setting it down and offering a sympathetic smile as he made a point of shifting his eyes to a pair seated across the small dining room. Following his gaze with a subtle eye movement of her own, she saw a man and a woman, wearing long coats, much like her own, all in dark fabrics with dark clothing peaking through from beneath. The man appeared to be around seven feet tall and had a few patches of metal showing around his neck and the side of his head. Tell tale signs of cybernetic modifications. The woman was of medium height and had elongated nostrils that opened up the sides of her nose slightly. The look was made even more creepy by the strange orange-yellow color of her eyes and the thin, forked tongue that occasionally darted out of her mouth as she and her companion spoke quietly to one another. They made a good show of just being out for lunch, but everything about them screamed \u0026lsquo;mercenaries on the hunt\u0026rsquo;.\nNodding her thanks to the waiter, she reached for the plate with her right hand and slid it closer to herself. As she did so, her gaze fell on her left hand, fingers still spread out over the table\u0026rsquo;s surface. All at once it struck her, like a physical blow to the head. She reeled back in her chair, gasping at the realization. \u0026ldquo;I can be so dense sometimes,\u0026rdquo; she said under her breath, twisting her hand back and forth, remembering how it had felt when Gregory Shantal, still the strange grey-haired, overall-wearing cyborg then, had cut it off.\nAssuming her epiphany about Anja\u0026rsquo;s origin was correct, that left only the question of what Anja was doing next. She\u0026rsquo;d blazed a trail across the solar system, starting on Mars, then rolling through Venus Station, and finally ending up in Neo-Tokyo. What was the common element? Picking at her food as she pondered, her ears twitched at the sound of a person approaching. She saw him coming out of the corner of her eye, and angling her ears back a bit, she was able to pinpoint the woman, who had moved out of sight to position herself between Riana\u0026rsquo;s table and the back door.\nSetting her fork down and wiping her mouth, Riana looked up at the dark figure as he came to a stop in front of her. He struck a pose, trying to make himself look even larger, and stared down at her with his faintly glowing eyes. Swallowing her last bite, she smiled at him and said, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t suppose it would make much difference if I told you I wasn\u0026rsquo;t her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; he responded with a mild amusement in his tone.\n\u0026ldquo;Wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be the first time you\u0026rsquo;ve heard that, I\u0026rsquo;m sure,\u0026rdquo; she added, eliciting a nod from him.\n\u0026ldquo;For what it\u0026rsquo;s worth, I believe you,\u0026rdquo; he said.\nRiana narrowed her eyes at him, looking him up and down.\n\u0026ldquo;We just got the call,\u0026rdquo; he answered her unasked question. \u0026ldquo;Someone here reported you and we were called in to get you, as quietly as possible. Now we either go back with you, or with a damn good explanation as to why we don\u0026rsquo;t have you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, I\u0026rsquo;m guessing a rational explanation with a promise of taking care of the real problem won\u0026rsquo;t cut it as an explanation?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Afraid not. You know these types, all business\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he began.\n\u0026ldquo;No compromise,\u0026rdquo; she finished, nodding. \u0026ldquo;So, can I finish my lunch, or call my boyfriend and tell him where I\u0026rsquo;m off to before we begin?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not paid by the hour,\u0026rdquo; he shook his head.\n\u0026ldquo;Then can we at least go outside? I like this place and I have no desire to shoot it up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, you\u0026rsquo;re set on fighting?\u0026rdquo; He took a half step back and pulled his long jacket open to reveal a rather impressive arsenal beneath it, strapped to his person.\n\u0026ldquo;No,\u0026rdquo; Riana said, shaking her head. \u0026ldquo;But you aren\u0026rsquo;t exactly a bubbling fountain of options that lead to another destination. I\u0026rsquo;m just trying to be practical.\u0026rdquo; She cast a curious eye around his weaponry, raising an eyebrow at a couple of the more serious pieces of hardware. \u0026ldquo;Is that a Quark Industries plasma pistol?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; he smirked.\n\u0026ldquo;If you fire that thing in here, you could kill a dozen people.\u0026rdquo; Her face soured. Her words carried just far enough that a ripple of panic began to wash over the dining room, which had fallen deathly silent in the wake of the pair\u0026rsquo;s actions. A few of the closer people began to stand up and try to quietly excuse themselves, which caused a flood of others to start moving as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Dammit,\u0026rdquo; he grumbled, reaching for a pistol in his shoulder harness.\nWith every ounce of calm she could muster, Riana slid to the edge of the bench seat and stood up to face the man, offering his companion a spare glance in the process. For her part, she was standing by the back door, popping her knuckles and looking a little nervous about the whole situation. Locking her eyes on his, Riana pressed her lips into a hard line and shook her head. \u0026ldquo;My name is Riana. Riana Thorindal. Daughter of Ezrina and Kilishandra. The person you think I am is Anja. She is a psychotic who happens to be using a copy of my body for her own purposes. What those purposes are, I haven\u0026rsquo;t quite divined yet, but I will, and then I will stop her. But for that to happen, I am afraid that I cannot allow you to take me anywhere. By the same token, I will not allow you to harm these people. So, either you back off and try again some other time, or we take this outside like civilized people.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fine,\u0026rdquo; he spat, raising his voice so his companion could hear it over the growing din of the increasingly panicked crowd, \u0026ldquo;the hard way it is.\u0026rdquo;\nAs he drew his weapon, Riana closed the distance between them with a quick step. Pressing up against him to block him from cross-drawing his pistol, she reached inside his jacket, gripped the butt of the plasma pistol in her left hand as she winked at him, and then slipped through sub-space, leaving him in the restaurant.\nScanning her surroundings for any signs of trouble, or that anyone had seen her just appear, she quickly tucked the plasma pistol into the pocket of her jacket and keyed up Vincent on her comm link. \u0026ldquo;Vin, I had to move, a couple mercenaries came at me and I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to start a scene.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; he responded without so much as a hitch. \u0026ldquo;Where are you now? I\u0026rsquo;ll head your way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m in that park you found me in after Firiel and I fought. But I don\u0026rsquo;t think you should come after me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she trailed off.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright. I\u0026rsquo;ll find a way into Neo-Tokyo and we can meet inside, once we\u0026rsquo;re all clear. Ping me back in twelve hours.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana nodded, relieved by his acceptance of the situation, as she marked the time on her internal chronometer. \u0026ldquo;Okay. I love you. Be safe.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I love you too,\u0026rdquo; he said, warmth filling the void before the line went dead.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay,\u0026rdquo; she breathed, turning around to give her surroundings one more inspection. \u0026ldquo;Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026nbsp;\nChapter 3\n"

	"content": "The Kestrel hurtled away from the small space station at maximum throttle. The ion drives screamed in protest as Riana leaned on the throttle, trying to coax more out of the straining engines than they seemed wiling to give.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to break something, Ree,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina commented as she stepped into the cockpit from the staging area. She had dashed into the ship from the wounded station and Riana had cycled the airlock closed and bolted away from the facility as soon as she\u0026rsquo;d confirmed that Willhelmina was aboard.\nWillhelmina had quickly pulled off her weapons and stowed them in the staging area and was now sliding into her seat. Her long, raven hair was pulled into a tight braid that hung to the middle of her back and her bright, green eyes inspected Riana suspiciously. Her athletic form fit the contours of the acceleration seat\nperfectly as she pulled the harness closed across her body.\n\u0026ldquo;I want to put as much distance between us and them as I can. There\u0026rsquo;s been enough death and destruction for the day.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied with a sour look on her face. Her own dark purple hair was pulled back into a ponytail that dangled down to the small of her back and her normally bright, violet eyes were dark and brooding. Her long, tapered, elven ears were swept back from her head, displaying a level of annoyance that seemed to be increasingly, and disturbingly, normal these days.\nWillhelmina continued to watch Riana for a moment, then sighed heavily as she produced a small data crystal from one of her belt pouches. She looked at it for a moment before slipping it into the protective metallic carrying case and snapping the container shut, sealing the thing inside.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s bugging you, Ree?\u0026rdquo; she asked as she smoothed some errant strands of her long, raven hair out of her face and secured it to the mass behind her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing.\u0026rdquo; Riana lied, keeping her violet eyes focused on the control panel to try and conceal the deception. But her long, tapered ears splayed out from her head, revealing her distaste for the situation and foiling her attempt at avoiding the conversation.\nWillhelmina nodded at her friend. \u0026ldquo;Right. Nothing.\u0026rdquo; Her emerald eyes glared at Riana knowingly. Even without her elven ears to betray her emotions, Willhelmina had spent far too many years with her purple-haired friend to be fooled.\n\u0026ldquo;I just keep wondering why we are doing this Kat. We aren\u0026rsquo;t couriers. We are some kind of special operations death squad or something. Running around and scooping up Xavier\u0026rsquo;s treasures and laying waste to anyone who gets in the way.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina sighed again as she poked idly at a few controls on the panel in front of her. \u0026ldquo;Ree this disc contains all of the source code for Kalijor. If anyone was to get hold of this they would be able to use it to figure out how Kalijor works and exploit any weaknesses in the system.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana backed off the throttle a touch and instantly the engines sounded less like they were winding up to an explosion. Jabbing her index finger at the autopilot button, she spun her chair around to face her sister. \u0026ldquo;I understand that Kat, but it still doesn\u0026rsquo;t feel right. I mean how many people have to die? Will he ever be satisfied?\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina turned to face Riana, folding her arms under her breasts and screwing up her face. \u0026ldquo;Ree, he may be cold, but he is not evil. He is trying to protect Kalijor, which is something I would think you, of all people, could appreciate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure of anything any more Kat. All I really know is that we are buzzing around the solar system at Xavier\u0026rsquo;s whim, breaking into places we shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be, to get things he says he has lost. I mean, he looses more stuff than anyone I have ever met before in my life! And why is it that every time we find whatever it is,\nit is inevitably surrounded by legions of armed soldiers?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;This is a cut-throat business Ree. And Solidarity has a corner on the market. They have for over one-hundred years now, and the competition gets tired of playing second fiddle.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana raised an eyebrow at Willhelmina. \u0026ldquo;How can the Conglomerate allow this sort of activity? Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t they be protecting Kalijor since it is used as the medium for most electronic meetings and transfers? I would think it would be in their best interests to keep it functioning properly.\u0026rdquo;\nWillhelmina shook her head, relaxing her arms a bit. \u0026ldquo;No, they don\u0026rsquo;t care. Even though Solidarity Online is ruling the field, there are others playing the game. The Conglomerate can use any of them just as easily, so they don\u0026rsquo;t really care who is running it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So they are going to let us kill each other over it regardless,\u0026rdquo; Riana huffed, folding her own arms across her chest and slumping down into the acceleration seat a bit.\n\u0026ldquo;They have a Darwinist philosophy about it, Ree. The system that is best fit to fill the void will be the one to survive. While some of what we do may be distasteful, it is necessary to keep Kalijor running, and we need to keep Kalijor running in order to keep Ezrina alive and figure out what is going on in there.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana narrowed her eyes as she stared at some point on the wall over Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s right shoulder. Her ears drooped down low in disgust at the situation. \u0026ldquo;Maybe. But I don\u0026rsquo;t have to like it,\u0026rdquo; she finally acquiesced as she turned back toward the controls and sat up in her chair.\n\u0026ldquo;Twenty hours to The Tyconderoga. You want to have a bite to eat?\u0026rdquo; She spun her chair fully around and stood up as she spoke, moving into the staging area and finally setting about stowing her own artillery in the various racks and bins.\n\u0026ldquo;Sure,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina said as she unbuckled herself from her seat and moved into the area, squeezing between Riana and the bulkhead, on her way toward the tiny galley. Pulling a compartment open, she peered inside at the rows of foil-wrapped packages stacked up neatly in the various compartments, all labeled nicely so that they were easily identifiable by contents. \u0026ldquo;So, what\u0026rsquo;ll it be?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana leaned over, peering past Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s shoulder at the myriad of packets as she continued to unbuckle her combat webbing. \u0026ldquo;Um\u0026hellip; Banana and beef,\u0026rdquo; she said as she straightened up again and stepped out of the combat webbing. She then set about inspecting the various straps and buckles for signs of wear or damage as Willhelmina stared at her incredulously. After a few silent seconds she looked up into her friend\u0026rsquo;s disbelieving face. \u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t think anyone actually ate that stuff,\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina finally said, still staring at Riana oddly.\n\u0026ldquo;I like it,\u0026rdquo; Riana said dismissively as she stowed her webbing on the hanger and turned back toward the kitchenette in time to receive the small foil packet. Tearing the top of the packet off with her teeth, Riana spit the waste into a receptacle in the wall and squeezed the base of the packet. A candy-bar sized chunk of dehydrated foodstuff slid up out of the packet and she bit off a chunk, chewing it thoughtfully as she stared at the weapon rack.\n\u0026ldquo;Something else on your mind?\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina asked as she opened her own packet.\n\u0026ldquo;I was thinking about catching the next Resonance show. She\u0026rsquo;s supposed to be on Earth Station next week,\u0026rdquo; Riana said around a mouth-full of banana-flavored dehydrated beef.\n\u0026ldquo;You think she\u0026rsquo;ll actually be there? Or will she be broadcasting there from somewhere else?\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina eyed her food suspiciously before taking another bite.\n\u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;ll be there,\u0026rdquo; Riana said definitively, nodding to her dinner as if to reinforce her hope.\n\u0026ldquo;And the visit wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have anything to do with a certain Captain would it?\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina grinned knowingly at her sister.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana cast her gaze on the floor, ears splaying out and flushing red. \u0026ldquo;We haven\u0026rsquo;t had a chance to get together in a couple of months now. I miss him.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I bet you do!\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina grinned knowingly.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s not like that Kat.\u0026rdquo; Riana looked at her sister out the tops of her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Well if it isn\u0026rsquo;t, then it should be.\u0026rdquo; Willhelmina grinned even wider as she returned to her meal.\nOn to Chapter 3\n"

	"content": "\u0026ldquo;Holy hell!\u0026rdquo; Vin spat as the body of the woman spilled out on the deck of the cargo hold.\nImmediately he knelt down beside her and touched his fingers to her neck, checking for a pulse. As he touched her, she rolled over onto her back and Vin reflexively shrank back from her as she came into full view.\n\u0026ldquo;What the frig?!\u0026rdquo;\nAs the light streamed down on the form before him he curled up the edge of his lip in distaste. The body was not that of a young woman after all, at least not completely. Most of the left side of the figure bore the soft, shapely curves of a young woman with athletic, toned muscles and the appearance of a strong youth about her. Half of her face was very attractive, with high cheek bones and delicate features, including a long ear that tapered to a thin point, long inches from her head. The left side of her chest looked to bear a firm, shapely breast, although it was difficult to tell through the dirty coveralls and smudged T-shirt, and the left hip and thigh were also that of an athletic young woman.\nThe person\u0026rsquo;s right side however, was an entirely different person. The right side of the figure was that of a skinny, but seemingly well muscled man. His face was thin and gaunt, and appeared perfectly at home in the dirty, tattered coveralls and ugly T-shirt. The female half of the figure\u0026rsquo;s head bore a long, thick shock of icy blue hair while the male half bore a wispy halo of thin grey/white hairs. The dividing line between the two very different halves of the figure looked like an open, festering wound that ran from the upper left thigh, through the center of the body and directly between the eyes, almost perfectly bisecting them. Looking closer at the wound he saw a thick, transparent fluid that seemed to flow around the wound like a river in constant motion, although it never splashed out of the wound or even dripped away on the underside of the body.\n\u0026ldquo;What the hell have you gotten me into here Lou?!\u0026rdquo; He cursed under his breath as he stepped back from the figure and looked at his portable scanner again. Quickly he st the device to check for airborne pathogens and chemicals. The device ran through a testing cycle and then chirped the all clear, which allowed him to breathe a sigh of relief. Again he bent down toward the figure on the deck and pointed the scanner at them, keying a few more controls and starting another scan. Finally the device chirped again and he inspected the display.\n\u0026ldquo;Nanites\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; His voice trailed off as he lowered the device to his side and inspected the long, vertical wound on the figure\u0026rsquo;s body. \u0026ldquo;What they hell are they doing?\u0026rdquo;\nAfter poking at his scanner for a few more minutes he finally decided on a course of action. Pulling some bedding from his cabin he set up a palette on the floor and gently rolled the figure over onto it, grunting at the unexpected weight of the person and paying careful attention to not touching the open wound with its river of nanites.\nFinally he slipped back out of the cargo hold, locking the door securely behind him and made his way back to the cockpit where he quickly keyed up Lou\u0026rsquo;s comm.. The lights in the cockpit dimmed slightly as a holographic image of Lou\u0026rsquo;s head appeared in mid-air over the main console. It was a fat, round, slightly balding head with a well-manicured beard and moustache and sharp, intelligent, hazel eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Vin my boy! What can I do for you?\u0026rdquo; Lou\u0026rsquo;s steady tenor voice filled the room.\n\u0026ldquo;You can tell me what the hell you have me hauling here Lou. You know I\u0026rsquo;ll do just about anything for you but hauling bodies is more than a little over the line.\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s face wrinkled up as Vin spoke to him, clearly his words struck strangely. \u0026ldquo;Wait a sec there Vin, who\u0026rsquo;s hauling bodies? That crate is supposed to have a dozen cases of Jovian brandy in it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Brandy?! Lou you sent me half way across the system to deal with Axel of all people for a crate of brandy?!\u0026rdquo; Vin slumped back in his chair and ran his fingers through his blond hair with a heavy sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re damn right I did! That\u0026rsquo;s the best brandy in the system and the damn feds have Jupiter tied up in more red tape than I can get through on my best day. I\u0026rsquo;m having a little sware here next weekend and I need that brandy to set the mood if you know what I mean.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t believe this crap. You told me this was a milk run Lou. You told me there wouldn\u0026rsquo;t be any more like Mercury, ever again.\u0026rdquo; Vin was talking into his hands now, holding them over his face in exasperation.\n\u0026ldquo;Calm down Vin, what\u0026rsquo;s going on?\u0026rdquo; Lou\u0026rsquo;s voice managed to sound almost interested in the answer.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on?\u0026rdquo; Vin slapped his hands down on the armrests of his chair and pushed himself upright in the contoured fixture. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s going on is that there is an unconscious, nanite-infected, mutant in my cargo hold Lou! And it came in your crate instead of your damn Jovian brandy!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A nanite-infected mutant? Vin you\u0026rsquo;re talking crazy man. What the frig is going on up there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; Vincent stopped himself half-way through the statement and decided instead to punch a couple of buttons on his holographic control panel, sending an image from the cargo hold cameras across the net to Lou\u0026rsquo;s terminal. \u0026ldquo;There. THAT\u0026rsquo;S what\u0026rsquo;s going on. You explain it to me!\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s face contorted a bit as he inspected the video stream from the camera. \u0026ldquo;What the frig is THAT?\u0026rdquo; he finally managed.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know Lou. That\u0026rsquo;s why I\u0026rsquo;m calling. THAT, came out of your crate.\u0026rdquo;\nLou quirked an eyebrow as he inspected the image with a deeper scrutiny. Finally his look turned angry and his voice rose several octaves. \u0026ldquo;Hey! Where\u0026rsquo;s the rest of my brandy?! There\u0026rsquo;s only four cases in there!\u0026rdquo;\nVin slapped himself in the face suddenly, dragging his hand down his reddened cheek in dismay. \u0026ldquo;Lou. There is a strange, mutant, PERSON on my SHIP. This strange, mutant, PERSON, came out of a crate that I picked up for YOU. To hell with your friggin BRANDY!! What am I supposed to do with this\u0026hellip; person?\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s expression softened a bit as he looked over his own console for something or other. \u0026ldquo;Look Vin, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about that, it\u0026rsquo;s just that I was counting on\u0026hellip; well never mind that anyway. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what\u0026rsquo;s going on. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t supposed to be anything in that crate except the brandy. If I didn\u0026rsquo;t know any better I would think maybe Axel is trying to get back at you for that last run-in you two had.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s all well and good Lou, but Axel didn\u0026rsquo;t know I was coming until I was there. Unless you told him.\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s face turned guilty for the briefest of instants, then apologetic. \u0026ldquo;Well, I may have\u0026hellip; I mean\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh Lou, tell me you didn\u0026rsquo;t tell him before hand\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Vin swore silently to himself as his friend\u0026rsquo;s face turned even more guilty. \u0026ldquo;Dammit Lou, how could you do that? No names Lou. It\u0026rsquo;s the first friggin rule, NO NAMES!!\u0026rdquo;\nLou started stammering, clearly he was sorry for the slip up. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Vin\u0026hellip; I just\u0026hellip; No one else would take the job. He\u0026rsquo;s fragged relations with every other runner in the system and he knows it. When we arranged the pick-up he mentioned you by name and I just agreed with him. I swear I didn\u0026rsquo;t do it on purpose.\u0026rdquo;\nVin grimaced at the disembodied head before pressing his lips into a thin line and looking at the camera feed from the cargo hold. The person was still laying quietly on the palette of blankets he had set up.\n\u0026ldquo;Forget it Lou. Damage done. But now you are in this with me. I need you to run this persons\u0026hellip; eh\u0026hellip; faces through the system. Find out whatever you can and get back to me. I am going to divert to the dregs and see if I can find a hidey hole to set down in for a while until we can figure out what Axel dumped on me.\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s face changed again, this time he was all professional. He nodded agreement and tapped a few controls on his console. \u0026ldquo;Doing it now, as messed up as it is though, it is going to take a while. Do you have anything else I can work with? How about an RFID?\u0026rdquo;\nVincent shook his head. \u0026ldquo;None. At least not that my scanners can pick up at any rate. Could be a runner, or maybe a merc? But what the hell is happening to them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wish I could be more help there. You said something about nanites?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah. Here.\u0026rdquo; Vincent tapped a few controls and sent the information from his portable scanner across the comm. link. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what exactly is going on here but that ugly open wound seems to be filed with nanites, and they are very busy doing something, although I am not at all sure what.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, I\u0026rsquo;ll look into it. Contact me again when you touch down in the dregs, hopefully I\u0026rsquo;ll have something by then.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent sighed again as he punched a new course into the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s auto-pilot and pushed the throttle up a bit. The sooner he got under cover the better off he would be. \u0026ldquo;I will, I am putting the heat on so I should be in the dregs in\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo; he glanced at his HUD briefly, \u0026ldquo;twenty-two hours and change.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to you again then, stay safe Vin.\u0026rdquo; Lou\u0026rsquo;s head turned away as if he were walking out of a room, then suddenly whirled around again, \u0026ldquo;And Vin?\u0026rdquo;\nVincent looked up from his controls back to the disembodied head once more. \u0026ldquo;Yeah?\u0026rdquo;\nLou frowned slightly before he spoke. \u0026ldquo;For what\u0026rsquo; it\u0026rsquo;s worth. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry about this. I didn\u0026rsquo;t mean to et you in any trouble.\u0026rdquo; He sounded genuinely concerned for Vin\u0026rsquo;s well being.\nVincent grinned mischievously at the image. \u0026ldquo;I know. That\u0026rsquo;s why we can still be friends. I\u0026rsquo;ll talk to you tomorrow.\u0026rdquo;\nLou\u0026rsquo;s face went back to its business-like appearance then and he nodded. \u0026ldquo;Stay safe friend, and good journey.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent waved his hand through the image of his friend\u0026rsquo;s head and it instantly winked out of existence, returning the cockpit lights to their normal level. He tapped away at his holographic controls for a few moments before leaning back into his chair and stretching himself out languidly and looking out the view-port into the open space surrounding the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity.\nHe almost began to relax before his eyes caught sight of the video feed from the cargo hold and he noticed that the palette was now devoid of the strange figure from the crate.\n"

	"content": "Riana\u0026rsquo;s fingers screamed out at her to stop as she held onto the rock ledge with all her strength. Her long platinum tresses were matted about her finely featured face and her mage\u0026rsquo;s robes were tangled around her thin body and long athletic legs as she dangled from the precipice with one hand.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip; told you\u0026hellip; this was\u0026hellip; bad idea\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina huffed, half in tears as she dangled from Riana\u0026rsquo;s other hand. Her own platinum tresses were better restrained behind her head, her long, tapered ears laying back from her head in fear. She looked from the ground far below them up into her sister\u0026rsquo;s Violet eyes, squinting her own golden orbs to get a better look through the wind-blown tears running down her face.\n\u0026ldquo;I know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana growled through her own body\u0026rsquo;s protests as her fingers screamed out in protest. \u0026ldquo;Would you mind\u0026hellip; loosing a hundred pounds real quick?\u0026rdquo; She gritted her teeth as Katrina swung herself into the cliff face and grabbed hold of the surface, removing her weight from her sister\u0026rsquo;s body.\nRiana quickly grabbed hold of another rock ledge and shifted her weight to relieve some of the pressure on her sore hand. \u0026ldquo;You ok Kat?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina was clinging to the rock face with all her strength, her arms and legs shook with adrenalin and fear. She took a moment to cast her sister above her a disparaging look. \u0026ldquo;I just nearly died Ree. What are we DOING up here?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Looking for a root.\u0026rdquo; Riana huffed as she resumed climbing.\n\u0026ldquo;A ROOT?!\u0026rdquo; Katrina nearly lost her grip again as she shouted after her sister. \u0026rdquo;I have nearly died SIX TIMES on this trip and you are telling me it is all over a ROOT?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah.\u0026rdquo; Riana grunted as she pulled herself up onto a large shelf an sat against the wall of the cliff, taking a moment to catch her breath. A moment later Katrina scrambled up onto the shelf next to her and punched her in the shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;So what, may I ask, is this mysterious root-worth-dieing-for to be used for?\u0026rdquo; She huffed for breath as she pulled a water skin from her robes.\nRiana cast her sister a sideways glance before snatching the water skin from her before she even had a chance to get a drink. Pressing the skin tightly to her lips she took a long pull and swallowed hard several times before allowing Katrina to steal the vessel back again.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip; for a class project\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana finally replied as she chased a small piece of rock of the ledge with her finger.\nKatrina eyed her once more before getting a drink of her own from the water skin. \u0026ldquo;Whatever. When you want to talk about it, just let me know.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana raised an eyebrow at her sister thoughtfully, then chased the matted hair away from her face and tied the unruly locks together behind her head and glanced up the cliff to get an idea of the climb that was ahead of them. Slowly she pushed herself up off the ledge and turned to face the looming challenge. Keeping her eyes on the far-away top of the cliff, she pulled a long string from a pocket in her robes and used it to tie her sleeves up, baring her slender arms. Another string quickly secured the hem of her robe to her legs, essentially creating a pair of Capri pants that afforded her a better view of her lower legs and feet.\nAfter a long moment, Katrina joined her in staring up the vertical face. \u0026ldquo;No time like the present eh?\u0026rdquo; She offered with little excitement in her voice.\nRiana nodded minutely, then attacked the wall with surprising vigor considering the fact that they had already been at it for over an hour now.\nA few minutes later Katrina\u0026rsquo;s curiosity, or maybe her frustration, got the better of her after her probing hand had disturbed a bird nest and resulting in her being nearly thrown from the cliff wall again. \u0026ldquo;What class did you say this project was for?\u0026rdquo; She grunted as she pulled herself up another six inches.\nRiana took a moment away from the climb to glare down harshly at her sister, finally returning her attention to the ascent and reaching up for another hand hold. \u0026ldquo;Alchemy.\u0026rdquo; She grunted as she pulled herself up the cliff a few more inches.\nFor a few minutes more there was nothing but the sounds of the girls pulling themselves slowly up the rock face, their breath coming harshly and nearly every hand or foot movement loosing a tiny stream of pebbles or dust that filled the air around them like a thin, red fog. At last Katrina spoke again, her voice low and determined. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m in you alchemy class Ree\u0026hellip; This is NOT an alchemy assignment.\u0026rdquo;\nMore long moments passed, during which time, the twin\u0026rsquo;s eyes managed to connect once, Riana\u0026rsquo;s violet eyes were icy with threats of bodily harm on her sister\u0026rsquo;s person if the matter was pressed much further. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s extra credit. You know I\u0026rsquo;ve been skipping too much class to make the grade without it.\u0026rdquo;\nThis either satisfied Katrina\u0026rsquo;s need to know, or thoroughly convinced her to let the matter rest.\nIt took another hour for them to reach the top of the ascent, and when they did, Katrina was not excited by what they saw there. The summit of the cliff opened up into a large shelf, easily large enough to play host to a well appointed home. In the center of the shelf was a large, tangled mass of plants, twigs, and what looked like bones and animal skins, all molded into a shape that looked suspiciously to Katrina like a very large bird\u0026rsquo;s nest.\n\u0026ldquo;Ree. Why does that look like a gryphon nest?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think because it is?\u0026rdquo; Riana replied flatly as she untied the strings restraining her robes and stuffed them back into the interior of the garment somewhere.\nKatrina gaped at her sister. \u0026ldquo;And where you, in fact, aware of the presence of this nest before we began this trip?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure really\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana shrugged, pulling her dagger from its sheath and holding it up to the waning light of the evening. The finely crafted dwarven blade reflected gold in the fading light, its keen edge looked as though it could slice through her arm with little effort.\nKatrina was visibly restraining herself from assaulting her sister by this point. \u0026ldquo;But you were aware that there may be the possibility of a gryphon nest being physically present here, however remote that may be?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I guess so.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied, very clearly done with the entire conversation at this stage.\nKatrina huffed loudly as she yanked her spell book from within some deep recess in her robes and loudly flicked through the pages until she seemed to settle on a desirable section, then sat down violently and hunched over the tome in the waning light. \u0026ldquo;Might\u0026rsquo;ve mentioned it you know. Oh, by the way Kat, there is a possibility, however remote, that we could face certain death at the top of the perilous ascent\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you through?\u0026rdquo; Riana shot back at her sister, her own ears now laid back in annoyance at the situation. \u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t want to scare you, the climb was bad enough as it was, and I couldn\u0026rsquo;t be sure the nest would be here so I didn\u0026rsquo;t see the point in getting you all worked up over something that nay never happen. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, it\u0026rsquo;ll never happen again.\u0026rdquo; Now Riana was facing her sister, shoulders squared and arms at her sides, the dagger clenched tightly not in any thoughts of attack, but rather her frustration with her sister\u0026rsquo;s attitude.\nKatrina looked up at her, golden eyes flashing for a second, before her features softened a bit and her shoulders released their tension. Her ears perked up a bit as she spoke again, \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Ree, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry I yelled. It just took me by surprise is all. Just give me a minute to memorize some different spells and we can go get your roots.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana deflated instantly. She could never stay mad at Katrina for long. Not just because they were sisters, but because Katrina was always so darn logical. She could knock the air out of anyone\u0026rsquo;s argument in an instant if she wanted to, and she always knew exactly what toggles to flip in order to make them mad as well. If she hadn\u0026rsquo;t known her sister so well, Riana would have sworn that she took delight in playing people against themselves.\nA moment later, Katrina was on her feet again and her spell book had disappeared back into the voluminous interior of her robes. With a quick flash she produced her own dwarven dagger from her sleeve and moved up next to her sister to face the nest.\nThe nest itself was a tangle of tree limbs, vines, branches, leaves, and straw with what looked like numerous bones and animal hides woven in for good measure. It was easily three times as tall as the twins and one-hundred feet in diameter with a large opening facing over the edge of the cliff. There was about fifteen feet of rock shelf between the opening and the edge of the sheer cliff that looked down over the forest of Brume and the Plain of Serenity far below them.\nAs the twins inched toward the opening they could hear a rustling sound from within the cavernous pile of wood and hide. It sounded as though there could be half a dozen somethings moving around inside the nest, possibly more.\n\u0026ldquo;How many do you think are in there?\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered to Katrina as they moved up toward the edge of the nest, their ears perked up and alert for any threats.\n\u0026ldquo;Sounds like six or seven. But they are all small, probably hatchlings. I just hope mom and dad aren\u0026rsquo;t anywhere near by.\u0026rdquo; Katrina whispered back. \u0026ldquo;So where is this root supposed to be?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana searched intently around the base of the nest for any sign of living plant material before spying a slender stem rising up out of a crack in the shelf and then intertwining into the woven wall of the nest. It was less than five feet from the opening into the interior. She pointed at the wispy plant tendril and Katrina rolled her eyes and stifled a dramatic sigh.\n\u0026ldquo;Of course. It would have to be there\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, and of course I need the roots not the shoot. Which means we need to get it out of the rock intact.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana could hear her sister shudder at the thought of the noise and effort that would be required to uproot the plant. There was no way they could do it without alerting the gryphon\u0026rsquo;s to their presence.\n\u0026ldquo;So what\u0026rsquo;s the plan Ree?\u0026rdquo; Katrina hissed in her sister\u0026rsquo;s ear, her body was hunched over Riana\u0026rsquo;s crouched form, almost fully in contact with her back they were so close together.\nRiana shrugged off her sister and crept forward toward the skinny plant, stooping down at its base to get a better look at how it was anchored in the rocky shelf. She grumbled to herself as she saw that the plant extended from the tiniest of crevices in the shelf. She was going to have to open the crack in order to extricate the plant without damaging its roots.\nTurning to face her sister, Riana shrugged her shoulders, ear splaying out wide from her head. Katrina\u0026rsquo;s face contorted into a visage of almost pure terror and she began shaking her head back and forth almost violently but it didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to deter Riana any at all as she closed her eyes and quietly chanted a few words of power.\nAn instant later there was a rumbling of stone as the tiny fissure began to widen and the crack stretched itself across the entire rock shelf with a series of deep crackling sounds that made Katrina think of her bones being splintered in the razor sharp beaks of a family of gryphons.\nAs the groaning protestations of the cliff face finally subsided the horrendous noise was punctuated by the absolute silence that followed. It took a moment to realize what the depth of the silence meant, but the point was driven home by the sudden ear-piercing screech that issued forth from the nest. The hatchlings were calling for their parents.\nThe twins looked at one another fir the briefest of moments before Riana turned back around and began working to dislodge the plant from its purchase and Katrina took to searching the failing daylight for any signs of mom or ad returning to the nest.\nRiana brought her dagger to bear on the rocky crag, chipping away at the loosened material, not even pausing when Katrina\u0026rsquo;s breath caught short in her lungs. She knew what was coming and she had to get what she was after before they were forced to deal with the creatures.\n\u0026lsquo;Be dealt with by the creatures is more like it.\u0026rsquo; She thought to herself as she frantically chipped away at the rocks with her dagger.\n\u0026ldquo;Ree. We have to go. NOW!\u0026rdquo; Katrina hollered as she yanked at her sister\u0026rsquo;s collar frantically, trying to get her to stand up and see what was winging toward them.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve got it!!\u0026rdquo; Riana exclaimed as she stood up, holding the scraggly plant aloft for all to see.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s great, now GET DOWN!!\u0026rdquo; Katrina screeched as she dove into her sister, knocking her bodily to the ground a mere heartbeat before the massive, razor sharp talons of an adult gryphon sliced through the air where her head had been an instant before.\nThe twins tumbled over one another for a few feet before landing in a heap. Two loud thumping sounds followed by several long scraping noises drew their attention toward the nest where they saw both the mother and father gryphons standing shoulder-to-shoulder, staring at them with their wide, avian eyes boring into them.\n\u0026ldquo;So what happens now oh fearless leader?\u0026rdquo; Katrina grumbled as she tried to disentangle herself from her sister and regain her feet, all without taking her eyes off of either of the huge predators.\n\u0026ldquo;I am open to suggestions at this point.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied simply as she took in the sight of the horse-sized creatures.\nThe gryphons stood about as tall as a mustang, but its body was primarially that of a large hunting cat\u0026rsquo;s, with the rear legs, hind quarters and central body mass of what looked to be a lion. Its front legs and fee were those of a powerful\u0026mdash;and extremely large\u0026mdash;bird o prey, with massive, curved talons that gouged into the solid rock face as the creatures stood there watching the twins. Their heads were avian as well, with wide, alert eyes and wicked sharp, curved beaks. Their gigantic wings were folded against their backs and ruffled restlessly as the giant predators appeared to be thinking about how to handle the interlopers. Their heads moved with quick twitching movements and their eyes never seemed to blink, instead taking in their surroundings in massive detail at all times.\nAs the girls regained their feet, standing up very slowly, the gryphons eyed them suspiciously but made no moves toward them, until Riana gasped and exclaimed \u0026ldquo;The plant!!\u0026rdquo; She spun around in a hurry and began scanning the shelf where they had fallen. Finally she located her prize, dangling precariously over the edge of the shelf.\nShe dove for the plant, snatching it up after several blundered attempts that nearly resulted in its falling beyond her reach. Katrina squealed in fright as Riana dove toward the edge and the gryphons reared up on their hind legs and screeched at the sudden flurry of activity.\nOne of the beasts charged the twins down, seemingly in an attempt to simply bowl the over the edge of the shelf, but Katrina\u0026rsquo;s shriek and sudden movement to the side alerted Riana to the danger and she rolled between the gryphon\u0026rsquo;s fore legs just in time to get clear of its wickedly sharp claws. With a quick movement she jabbed the plant into her robes and chanted an incantation that caused a spark of flame to suddenly ignite beneath the gryphon.\nThe animal screeched again as it reared back, trying to get clear of the flame and Riana rolled to the side, coming up into a crouching position, her dagger at the ready. The instant the gryphon realized that the source of the heat had moved away when its target had moved, it flapped its wings angrily and turned to face her with a malicious glint in its avian eyes before darting forward faster than any creature its size had a rite to move. Like a lightning bolt its beak lashed forward, slashing thro9ugh the air like a well-aimed sword stroke.\nRiana moved her dagger forward in an attempt to intercept the attack, but succeeded only in getting her forearm savagely cut across the outside. She was sure she would have lost her hand had it not been for her thick robes taking the brunt of the damage. She screamed out in pain and the sight of her blood running scarlet sown her forearm.\nWith a flash of anger Riana launched herself forward toward the gryphon, her dagger gripped with anger-reinforced strength. As she drew near the creature lashed out with one of its fore claws, but Riana twisted herself around, avoiding the brunt of the attack. She felt its wicked claws tear into her robes at her waist but kept herself focused on her objective. With another quick twist she was between its legs again and drove the point of her dagger into its feathered chest.\nThe gryphon shrieked in pain and spun around on all fours, knocking Riana bodily across the shelf where she skidded to a halt mere inches from a thousand foot plummet. She looked back at the gryphon, squinting through her blurred vision from the attack and watched as the gryphon pulled at the dagger embedded in its chest with its fore claws. A sudden shout from the other side of the shelf drew her attention and as she snapped her clearing vision around to locate the source she saw her sister backing away from the other gryphon, her dagger in one hand and gouts of flame issuing forth from her other hand.\nHer assailant seemed to be thinking about how to best get past her flaming defense to tear her sot tissues apart as it shifted from side to side and cocked its head back and forth, examining its quarry with a critical eye. He real issue that Riana saw was that as the creature tentatively advanced on her sister, she would step away from it and was quickly running out of usable space on the shelf.\nWithout thinking, Riana jumped up and dashed across the space between them. Running as fast as she could she dipped her chin down and drover her shoulder as hard as she could into the gryphon\u0026rsquo;s ribs. The animal staggered away from her as she crumpled backward under the recoil from her own attack and Katrina seized the moment and blasted the gryphon in the face with a flame tongue that sent it reeling away from them with a panicked shriek.\n\u0026ldquo;What the heck was that Ree? Why is it you totally forget about your spells whenever we run into serious trouble?\u0026rdquo; She stooped next to her sister and hauled her to her feet by her armpits as she admonished her.\n\u0026ldquo;Still looking for a good sword\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Was Riana\u0026rsquo;s explanation as she tried her best to get her legs under her and convince them to support her weight.\n\u0026ldquo;Whatever. I think we\u0026rsquo;ve pretty much overstayed our welcome here. You have what you need right?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana cringed at the thought. Her dagger was still stuck in one of the gryphons and she wanted it back. That dagger had been a gift to her from the city of Rathalon for when she and Katrina had helped the guard root out an infestation of mean little goblins from the aquaducts. \u0026ldquo;Almost. I just need to grab one more thing real quickly.\u0026rdquo;\nShe forced her balance to reassert itself and then stalked toward the gryphons which were attentively looking after one another\u0026rsquo;s wounds. When Riana approached with a glimmer of determination in her violet eyes and her ears laid back in intent they both turned to face her and raised their hackles, widening their stances in anticipation of an attack.\nRiana held out her arms showing that he hands were empty and that she was unarmed, then cocked her head to the side a bit, ears perked up. The gryphons reacted almost instantly, calming themselves down and lowering the feathers along their hackles. They eyed here suspiciously and still shifted uneasily but did not advance on her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry for the confusion.\u0026rdquo; She said in a soft voice as she took a small step toward the animals. She could hear the hatchlings squeaking nervously from within the nest again, this time they were more agitated, almost doubtful. Their parents looked back and forth from the nest to Riana, her sister standing behind her with a worried look on her face.\n\u0026ldquo;We came up here for this plant. We meant no harm to you or your children.\u0026rdquo; Slowly she reached into the front of her robes and withdrew the spindly plant, holding it out for the animals to see. The larger gryphon, the one with the knife in its chest quirked its head to the side and took a tentative step forward. Not a menacing advance, rather a probing step to see what would happen. Riana held the plant out for the creature to see.\n\u0026ldquo;I researched it thoroughly. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t say anywhere that you use it for anything, but I need the roots for something I am working on. I really didn\u0026rsquo;t mean for this to all get out of hand. If you will permit me, I will remove the knife\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;She pointed at the handle protruding from the animals chest, near its left shoulder. She obviously had not struck anything vital with the weapon but she was sure it would cause problems for the family if it were to stay in place. That and she didn\u0026rsquo;t want to lose the weapon either.\nShe advanced forward another step and the gryphon made no move to stop her. Slowly she transferred the plant to her left hand and reached deliberately for the handle of her weapon. Inching her way forward she gently touched the pommel of her dagger and the gryphon flinched a bit, but stayed in place as she moved even closer, wrapping her hand around the handle fully.\n\u0026ldquo;This may sting a bit. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry.\u0026rdquo; She said, then took three long breaths and yanked hard on the handle of the dagger. The long blade jerked free of the animal\u0026rsquo;s body with a sick sucking sound and a thin stream of blood followed the blade in a wide arc away from the gryphon. The animal shrieked again and reared up on its hind legs, knocking Riana to the ground in a heap. Unprepared for the fall she smacked her head on the rocky shelf and her world began to spin as the gryphon slammed its forelegs back down on the stone shelf and its claw gouged out huge furrows in the granite.\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s world spun, she couldn\u0026rsquo;t focus on anything and attempting to do so only made her head hurt worse. Looking up she saw the gryphon looking down at her, its head tilted to one side, then Katrina\u0026rsquo;s face filled her whirling view of the sky and gryphon as she felt her upper body being lifted slightly off the rapidly cooling stone.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Ree, I\u0026rsquo;ll get you to a healer.\u0026rdquo; She head her sister\u0026rsquo;s voice swimming through the mire of her mind. A moment later there was a flash of light and the spinning sky was replaced with the spinning stone ceiling o the Rathalon portal chamber. There was a sudden flurry of activity, bodies moving in random directions and people shouting back and forth. It all blended together into a cacophony of noise that washed up over her as the world went dark and she lost consciousness.\nWhen she opened her eyes she was greeted by the familiar canopy of her own bed. Looking to the side she saw that she was indeed in her own room, the familiar sights and scents greeted her senses and she could hear the sound of someone cooking in the kitchen down the hallway. Slowly she sat up, taking a moment to let the world stop spinning around her before she swung her feet off the bed and stood up, supporting herself against one of the bed posts. With a little effort she made her way to her wardrobe and pulled on some clothes, then dragged herself down the hallway to the dining room. Flopping down in one of the dining room chairs she leaned heavily on the table and focused her senses on the kitchen where she saw Katrina busily preparing something to eat.\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; She finally asked, surprising herself with how strong her voice was compared to how she felt.\nKatrina stopped what she was doing for a moment to cast a menacing look at her sister. As quick as the look had appeared however, it was gone again and she was attending to her culinary concoction once more. \u0026ldquo;You pulled your dagger out of the gryphon and it knocked you down. You hit your head pretty hard on the ground, if I didn\u0026rsquo;t know any better Ree I would say your skull is harder than that granite. Anyway, the gryphons let me grab you and I used the portal ring we took with us to get you back to Rathalon. As soon as we arrived the guards summoned a healer and after a very long night of patching you up and a day of sleeping like the dead, here you are.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana ran her fingers through her long platinum tresses, flinching when she encountered a tender spot at the back of her skull.\n\u0026ldquo;The healer said that would be sore for a few days, you may want to take it easy. He also said he hadn\u0026rsquo;t ever seen a bruise that size before. I\u0026rsquo;ve got to hand it to you sis, you don\u0026rsquo;t like to do anything small do you?\u0026rdquo; Katrina made her way out of the kitchen with a few dishes and set them out in front of Riana and an empty chair next to her.\n\u0026ldquo;Did the healer say how long it would take for the spinning sensation to stop?\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she clamped her hands to the sides of her head in an attempt to steady her world.\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, he said that could last a couple days as well, something about your brain swelling or some such. Personally I don\u0026rsquo;t buy that bit. I don\u0026rsquo;t think your head could possibly get any larger.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana offered her sister a menacing glare of her own as Katrina retreated to the kitchen to retrieve the food. She returned promptly and served up some sweet smelling meats and vegetables and the two dove in without any further words between them.\nWhen the food was gone, Riana\u0026rsquo;s head had slowed its spinning and she was better able to focus her attention so she helped her sister clear the dishes and then they sat down in the living room to look out at the starry night sky over Rathalon.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t suppose you picked up my dagger, or the plant?\u0026rdquo; Riana finally ventured.\nAt the mention of those items, Katrina\u0026rsquo;s face turned sour and she looked back at her sister emploringly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Ree, I didn\u0026rsquo;t think to grab them. Everything happened so quickly there wasn\u0026rsquo;t a moment to think\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nRiana sighed heavily as she looked out the balcony door. Finally she offered an affirming nod toward her sister. \u0026ldquo;Thanks for your help, I know it was a bit crazy. Next time I won\u0026rsquo;t keep you in the dark. I just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Ree. I get it. Just don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I won\u0026rsquo;t Kat. You\u0026rsquo;ll be the first to know what\u0026rsquo;s going on. But I\u0026rsquo;m not ready yet\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She stopped for a moment, unable to find the words.\nKatrina filled in the gap for her however, \u0026ldquo;I know Ree. Just know that when you are ready, I am here. I\u0026rsquo;ll always be here, you know that.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s eyes welled up with tears then. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t deserve you Kat.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Darn right you don\u0026rsquo;t! So don\u0026rsquo;t go trying to kill me any more!\u0026rdquo; Katrina mock-hollered across the living room. And the pair broke out in laughter that seemed to actually help clear Riana\u0026rsquo;s head rather than making it worse.\nFinally they managed to stifle their laughter and Riana wiped the tears form her eyes then looked back at her sister seriously. \u0026ldquo;So. When do we go back after my dagger and the plant?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina gaped at her incredulously for what must have been a full minute before she stood up and parked her hands on her hips, glared evily at her sister and raised a finger to point at her. \u0026ldquo;If you think for one instant that I, or even YOU for that matter, are going back up there EVER again\u0026hellip; Missy you have got another thing coming! There is no way in hells you are dragging me up there again, or anywhere even remotely similar! Never in my life have I ever\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHer tirade was suddenly cut off by a rush of wind billowing in through the balcony door and as the twins turned to see what was going on they were surprised by the complete absence of stars, or even sky. It took a moment to realize what was going on, but finally it dawned on them that there was a giant gryphon perched on their balcony, and the creature was completely blocking out the sky.\nThey stared dumbly at the gryphon for a few long moments, its softball sized eyes staring in at them unblinkingly the entire time. Finally the animal screeched in at them so loudly that some of the crystal in the kitchen actually shattered. Both of the twins leapt into one another\u0026rsquo;s arms in startled fright, but the gryphon made no aggressive moves. Instead the creature actually lifted one of its forelegs and folded it across its chest as best it could then dipped down low on its other leg, mimicking a curtsey of sorts.\nThe twins let go of one another and turned to face the animal, then at once they both curtseyed back to the gryphon which responded by standing up straight, screeching one more time then spreading its massive wings out and with one great flap and a gust of wind, hurtled up into the darkened sky.\nThe sisters rushed out onto the balcony and looked up in awe as they watched the gryphon winging away into the night, back toward the cliffs of the Uraval Mountains to the south. They watched until the gryphon was completely out of sight then looked at one another and grinned broadly, ears splayed out in excitement.\n\u0026ldquo;That was awesome!\u0026rdquo; Katrina gushed. \u0026ldquo;I was SO scared, I nearly peed myself!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana offered her sister a sour face. \u0026ldquo;Gross Kat. Did I really need to know that?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina looked slightly hurt, \u0026ldquo;Well I thought maybe you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She looked down at the floor of the balcony, a hurt expression on her face that quickly turned into a wide-eyed exclamation. \u0026ldquo;Um\u0026hellip; Ree?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked down at the space between them and then offered a surprised expression of her own. There on the floor between them lay her dagger, sparkling in the starlight and next to the knife were two plants, both fully intact, roots and all, and lastly there were two gryphon feathers, each more than a foot long and impossibly strong and light when they picked them up gingerly.\n\u0026ldquo;Do you know what these are?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked with the closest thing Riana had ever heard to lust in her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Um\u0026hellip; Feathers?\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she picked up her dagger and the two spindly plants with her free hand, offering the feather in her other hand a quick glance to see if there was anything strange or unusual about it other than its size.\n\u0026ldquo;Obviously.\u0026rdquo; Katrina replied in the know-it-all tone she used whenever she was about to start a lecture. \u0026ldquo;Not just any feather though. It\u0026rsquo;s a gryphon\u0026rsquo;s flight feather. And mores the point, it was offered up willingly by the gryphon that bore it!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana tried her best not to look completely baffled by her sister\u0026rsquo;s energy. \u0026ldquo;And this is so amazing because why again?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina rolled her eyes but continued on unabated. \u0026ldquo;Gryphon\u0026rsquo;s flight feathers are highly prized for their magical properties, especially when used as quills for scribing spells. The only thing better than a gryphon\u0026rsquo;s flight feather for scribing spells is one that was offered up willingly by the gryphon, any spells scribed with such a feather can be as much as ten times as powerful as one scribed with a stolen feather!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana raised her eyebrows at the feather as she moved back into the light of the living room, where she carefully set her treasures down on the table and inspected the feather more closely. The calamus of the feather was easily as large around as Riana\u0026rsquo;s pinky finger and the vane was wider than her hand with her fingers spread wide. It was around eighteen inches long and impossibly light for its size. The vane was a deep brown color with reds, blues and purples running through it depending upon which way she rolled it in the light of the room.\nFinally a slow smile crept across Riana\u0026rsquo;s face and the tips of her ears dipped down mischievously as she narrowed her eyes at the feather. \u0026ldquo;So, any spell scribed with this feather will be much more powerful than one scribed with a regular quill eh?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina nodded excitedly. \u0026ldquo;Compared to a spell scribed with a regular duck quill, or even a hawk or eagle, they could almost behave like completely different spells they will be so much stronger. Magic is said to be nearly as strong in a gryphon\u0026rsquo;s blood as it is in a dragon\u0026rsquo;s!\u0026rdquo;\nSlowly, Riana stood up from the couch and collected her things, being extremely careful with the feather and the plants. \u0026ldquo;I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to turn in Kat. I\u0026rsquo;ll see you in the morning.\u0026rdquo; She quietly moved out of the living room and into her bed room where she pulled the door closed behind her and moved across the room to her chest of drawers. Carefully she set her treasures down on the top of the furniture and then braced herself against the wall as she pulled the heavy chest away from the wall. Slipping her arm behind the furniture and feeling the bricks in the wall for the one she had specially prepared so many months ago.\nThe special brick hinged outward at her touch and she reached inside to remove the ornately carved Brumewood box from within. A gentle mist surrounded the darkened wood of the box as she set it on top of her chest of drawers and hinged the top open. The white mist that constantly surrounded Brumewood filled the space inside the box but it didn\u0026rsquo;t bother her, she knew where each and every item she had collected was within the concealed space.\nGently she removed the items one by one to inspect them each in turn. A scale from a cocktrice, shavings from a rhino\u0026rsquo;s horn, chittenous armor from a giant scorpion, herbs and roots collected from the corners of Rathalon\u0026rsquo;s bazaar and the wilds beyond the walls of the city itself. There were chunks of rock and crystal in an amazing array of colors, brighter than a spring rainbow and a few small vials of liquid in various colors as well. She sighed with the thought that her collecting was nearly through. Soon enough she would be able to start on the distilling of the core components and then she could mix the inks.\nGently and deliberately she returned each item to the box, adding the two plants the gryphon had given her with a smile, then she raised the feather to eye level and inspected it one last time as the smile turned into a grin. \u0026ldquo;And now, things will be even better when I am done. There won\u0026rsquo;t be a mage in the world that can do what I can\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe sound of her sister shuffling around in her room next door startled Riana out of her daydream with a jolt. She quickly added the feather to her box and closed it up. In a flash the box was returned to its hidden alcove and the furniture was replaced.\nRiana prepared herself for bed with a smile on her face, the slight spinning in her head not bothering her one bit as she brushed out her platinum tresses and then slid back into bed. In moments she was asleep and her lips curled into a wide grin as she dreamt of the scholars at the Magic Academy begging her for the secret to her magic, a secret that lay right beneath their noses. A secret that she had uncovered in their own library not more than six months ago. The secret to casting spells instantly and with no conscious power channeling or reading of spell books. Soon enough\u0026hellip;\n"

	"content": "Riana ducked to the side as the wild boar leapt past her. One of its wicked tusks gouged her upper arm as it passed. Gritting her teeth against the pain, her eyes flashed bright violet as she countered the noxious cloud of vapor spewing forth from the goblin chief\u0026rsquo;s fingers.\nThinking that this would be as easy as the other goblins had proved to be, turned out to be a foolish mistake. There was a very good reason this fellow was their leader. The creature was tall for a goblin, somewhere around five feet, but looked exactly like his brethren in all other respects. The same long, pointy nose and protruding eyebrows, gaunt, angular features, and cold black eyes made up his visage. He turned out to be an accomplished mage, conjuring up wild boars and lightning bolts as soon as he had seen the pair approaching.\nIt had also turned out that Jumah was quite adept at dealing with magical attacks. His weapon seemed to absorb most of the attacks and his speed allowed him to block even lightning bolts with it.\nAverting her gaze when he flashed a winning smile while dodging a fireball without looking, the rustling of leaves and branches drew her attention. The return of the conjured boar reminded her that she had to deal with it herself, while Jumah was keeping the goblin occupied. Her ears splayed out and she focused on the sounds behind her. Keying in on the animal\u0026rsquo;s snorting, ragged breath as it charged her, she waited until she heard its feet leave the ground as it leapt, then cast a stop-time spell.\nThe world around her turned grey and bleak, everything in it frozen in place. An eerie silence caved in on her ears like an explosion in the sudden absence of the sounds of battle. She pivoted on her heel, spinning around to face the boar. The creature was suspended mid air with a foul look in its eyes. Positioning herself to one side, she placed her hand on Elkorine\u0026rsquo;s handle and prepared to draw the weapon knowing that she would get only one chance.\nShe pulled in a deep breath of bestilled air and glanced toward Jumah just as she pulled the magical weapon from its sheath.\n\u0026lsquo;What the\u0026hellip;?\u0026rsquo; She thought to herself as the world suddenly sprang into full motion again. A cacophony of sounds smashed in on her sensitive ears like a tsunami breaking over a high cliff. Her focus snapped forward just in time to complete the graceful arc of her short sword as it swung out of its scabbard upward toward the startled looking boar. The boar ricocheted off Riana, knocking her to the ground. In a flash of electrical light the boar\u0026rsquo;s lifeless body collided full force with the chief\u0026rsquo;s head, stunning him. Jumah took the opportunity to land a killing blow with his swift blades.\nRolling to a sitting position Riana scanned the clearing to make sure they were safe. \u0026lsquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not possible\u0026hellip; time was frozen. He couldn\u0026rsquo;t have\u0026hellip;\u0026rsquo; She replayed the scene in her mind once more and she was sure of it. Just as she had glanced in his direction\u0026hellip; \u0026lsquo;He winked at me!\u0026rsquo;\nOn to Chapter 3\n"

	"content": "The Rathalon bazaar was something everyone should see at least once in their life. The two main roads through the city were lined on either side with merchant\u0026rsquo;s awnings under which stood tables, racks, stands, buckets, bushels, and hangers filled with anything anyone could possibly want. The treasures of Kalijor were here for the taking, if only the price could be met. People of all creeds and colors, species and sizes wandered the streets, from tent to tent, corner to corner; haggling, bartering, trading, buying, and selling. The bazaar itself put all this to shame. Easily the largest building in the city, it was packed with ten times the merchants as all of the city streets combined.\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome to my humble shop.\u0026rdquo; The finely featured elf said as the girls tumbled through the door. \u0026ldquo;If there is anything I can help you with please let me know.\u0026rdquo; He smiled happily.\nKatrina nodded in his direction and smiled as Riana started digging through the racks of fine silk garments.\n\u0026ldquo;I see you have an excellent eye m\u0026rsquo;lady. Those silks were imported from Avian just this morning. They were woven by some of the finest silk weavers in the land.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Oh Kat! This is amazing! I can hardly feel this material it\u0026rsquo;s so light and soft!\u0026rdquo; Riana cooed as she fondled a couple of the garments appreciatively.\nKatrina moved over near her sister and picked up the sleeve of a hanging blouse. Sliding the material back and forth between her fingertips she nodded her approval then turned her head slightly so that she could see the store\u0026rsquo;s proprietor in the corner of her eye. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s nice. But I\u0026rsquo;ve felt better. Remember that nightworm silk merchant we ran into in Talanor the other day? That stuff was way softer than this.\u0026rdquo; The man\u0026rsquo;s smile faltered a bit but he returned quickly.\nRiana was only briefly caught off guard by her sister\u0026rsquo;s comment. Recovering her wits quickly she smiled slightly and began playing her part. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s true. Such a nice little dwarf too! Hard to believe she was selling it so cheaply, it was just flying out her doors.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah. Maybe we should portal back over there and see if she has any more available. Remember that dark purple she had? It was amazing!\u0026rdquo; Now he was fidgeting a bit as he watched them.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh! This one is nice.\u0026rdquo; Riana said as she removed a sapphire colored silk tunic from the rack and gently held it up against her tattooed skin. \u0026ldquo;How much is it?\u0026rdquo; She looked at the uncomfortable man pointedly, turning slightly so that he could better see the garment.\n\u0026ldquo;Eh\u0026hellip; that one is fifty silver pieces m\u0026rsquo;lady.\u0026rdquo; He smiled hopefully as she looked back at him with a skeptical glance.\nKatrina turned around and leveled her gaze on the man, narrowing her golden eyes at him then turning back to her sister. \u0026ldquo;C\u0026rsquo;mon Ree, put it back, we\u0026rsquo;ll go back to Talanor where the prices are more reasonable and the silk is better. It\u0026rsquo;s worth the trip with as much as we\u0026rsquo;re going to need in order to refill your wardrobe.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana put on her best pouting face as she reluctantly let her sister take the tunic from her hands and return it to the rack. \u0026ldquo;Alright. I suppose you\u0026rsquo;re right,\u0026rdquo; she acquiesced.\nDramatically they made their way to the street, lingering a bit too long with each step and fingering a garment or two as they paraded toward the door. Finally the owner had enough and almost shouted, \u0026ldquo;my ladies if you intend to purchase a quantity of items I am sure we could arrange for a volume price.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina stopped half way to the door and turned slowly to look at him, her eyes narrowed again. \u0026ldquo;What sort of price?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah\u0026hellip; well, I\u0026hellip; How about thirty five silver\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;\nKatrina cut him off by turning back toward the door with a flourish and taking another step.\n\u0026ldquo;Thirty! Thirty silver each\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;\nIn an instant, Katrina whirled on the man and gave him her best stern look, her hands on her hips and ears parallel with the ground, pointing straight back from her head. \u0026ldquo;Twenty five silver each and not a copper more!\u0026rdquo;\nThe man looked like he had been slapped in the face. He hesitated for the briefest of moments, considering her words, during which time Katrina started turning toward the door again. Finally he came to a decision and called after them, \u0026ldquo;alright, twenty five silver each. But you have to buy a dozen or more.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina turned back around and smiled sweetly. \u0026ldquo;Deal.\u0026rdquo;\nNumerous pair of soft suede boots, several bodices and tunics in different styles and materials, some skirts, belts, greaves, gloves, capes, cloaks, and various other odds and ends later they made their way home, laden with packages and parcels. All told they had spent nearly fifty gold pieces, but had returned victorious, with bundles of new things to wear. The only thing they had not purchased, mostly due to its high cost and their inability to talk the store keeper down, was a set of leathers that was a deep, glossy black color with purple trim. It was a complete set and had been magically enchanted to increase its strength and softness, and reduce its weight. Its cut would have worked perfectly around Riana\u0026rsquo;s freshly tattooed skin, but the cost seemed simply too high.\nThey had immediately set about going through Riana\u0026rsquo;s wardrobe, piling up all of her robes and other long, concealing things on her bed. Katrina was stowing the last of the new items when Riana stepped behind the changing screen to don one of the new outfits.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok. Here goes.\u0026rdquo; She said tentatively as she stepped from behind the screen. She wore a very light, elven silk scarf that covered her breasts and formed a cross over her heart then tied behind her neck. Her lower half was draped with a similar silk that hung low on her waist and covered her with a low hanging breechcloth in front and back. In all it was extremely revealing, and to her, felt as though she was wearing nothing at all because the fabric was so light. She breathed a sigh of relief at the feeling of no longer having coarse fabrics constantly lighting up her nerve endings. It felt so much better that she didn\u0026rsquo;t much care what it looked like.\nKatrina stared, mouth hanging open. \u0026ldquo;Ree, I\u0026hellip; Oh wow,\u0026rdquo; Was all she could manage to say.\nRiana looked at herself in the full length mirror by her wardrobe, blushing from head to toe. \u0026ldquo;I see what you mean Kat, but it\u0026rsquo;s the only way I\u0026rsquo;m going to get anything done. At least until these tattoos heal a bit more. Wearing normal clothing is almost debilitating.\u0026rdquo; Looking in the mirror, she turned this way and that, inspecting her image from different angles and perspectives. It was very revealing, but nothing she couldn\u0026rsquo;t get used to, she supposed. The dark lines covering her body in intricate patterns were all visible. Briefly she wondered if this was all just part of the price she would pay for her deed.\n\u0026ldquo;Mom IS going to kill me.\u0026rdquo; She muttered out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe.\u0026rdquo; Katrina chimed in from the other side of the room, \u0026ldquo;But you\u0026rsquo;ll look darned good when you go.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana saw her sister\u0026rsquo;s grin in the mirror and grinned back. Then put her fingers to her temples again and tried to massage away the dull ache once more.\n\u0026ldquo;You should see a healer Ree.\u0026rdquo; Katrina sounded worried again. \u0026ldquo;Maybe there are side effects\u0026hellip; Something not in the notes. Or maybe something went wrong\u0026hellip;\u0026ldquo;\nRiana turned around and looked at her sister. \u0026ldquo;Nothing went wrong. Unless it went wrong enough for the wizard that recorded the procedure that they were unable to note it, there was no mention of it. Besides, like I said earlier, it started more than a week before I went to Talanor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe so. But you should STILL see a healer!\u0026rdquo; Katrina was definitely worried, she never got this insistent unless she was deadly serious.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright. I\u0026rsquo;ll go see a healer tomorrow.\u0026rdquo; Riana acquiesced.\n\u0026ldquo;Why tomorrow?\u0026rdquo; Katrina pushed the issue still further.\n\u0026ldquo;Because if mom kills me tonight, then I won\u0026rsquo;t have to worry about a healer tomorrow!\u0026rdquo; Riana said mockingly. \u0026ldquo;That and it will be dark in a few minutes, and unless it is an emergency, most healers won\u0026rsquo;t see people at night. I\u0026rsquo;ll be fine until tomorrow.\u0026rdquo; Riana busied herself with storing her robes and other displaced garments in a foot locker while she talked. Trying to keep her mind off her headache.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright.\u0026rdquo; Katrina finally gave in. \u0026ldquo;But you are going at first light, and I will go with you to make sure you get there!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough. Now help me get this mess cleaned up.\u0026rdquo;\nA moment later the brief transition into night occurred. The bright light of day quickly dimmed and faded away into night. It took less than two minutes to happen, and all at once it was night time. And with it came a knock at the front door.\nThe girls answered the door together, opening it to find a human male standing there. He wore dusty traveling gear, and looked as though he had just run a marathon. His light hair was matted to his forehead and he was winded, although his bright blue eyes shone with an inner energy. He was barely over the twin\u0026rsquo;s six foot height, and looked as though he weighed in under two-hundred pounds, mostly lean muscle. He smiled broadly when he saw the sisters beyond the threshold, raising an eyebrow at the sight of Riana, wearing not much more that a couple of silk scarves.\n\u0026ldquo;I am a courier. I was dispatched from the Burning Expanse this morning with a message for Ladies Katrina and Riana Thorindal. Might you be they?\u0026rdquo; His voice was a solid tenor and showed no signs of being winded, despite his outward appearance.\n\u0026ldquo;The Burning Expanse?\u0026rdquo; Katrina wondered aloud.\n\u0026ldquo;We don\u0026rsquo;t know anyone in the Burning Expanse!\u0026rdquo; Riana chimed in.\n\u0026ldquo;So you ARE Katrina and Riana Thorindal?\u0026rdquo; The man asked, obviously eager to deliver his dispatch.\n\u0026ldquo;We are,\u0026rdquo; the girls said in unison.\n\u0026ldquo;Very well then,\u0026rdquo; he said. He reached into a satchel slung over his shoulder and produced a sealed parchment. \u0026ldquo;My instructions say that I am to give this only to the two of you together, and that you must first show me the matching seal.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina and Riana stared at him blankly for a moment. This was a very strange turn of events. Finally Riana shook herself and said, \u0026ldquo;Just a moment, let me get mine.\u0026rdquo; Then she disappeared into her chamber for a moment and returned with her seal in hand.\nShe handed it to the messenger, who inspected it, and compared it against the wax seal on the parchment. Then nodded his approval and handed both items to Riana. \u0026ldquo;Here you are. Thank you.\u0026rdquo; He then bowed to them and took a step back from the door, \u0026ldquo;Now if you ladies will excuse me, I have other deliveries to make.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course! Thank you very much.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said as she watched him head down the stairs, closing the door after he was out of sight.\nAlone again, the girls inspected the parchment. It bore the family seal, which meant it had to be from their mother, as she had the only seal that was out of the house currently. Gently, Riana tried to slide her thumb nail under the wax seal, but it did not budge.\n\u0026ldquo;He said together.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said aloud. Then she placed her thumb on the other side of the seal and together they applied pressure. The seal popped loose, and the wax melted away into nothingness. Quickly, Riana unfolded the parchment to reveal the elegant, practiced script of their mother. It was a large letter, and it looked to have been written in something of a hurry, as the hand was not up to Ezrina\u0026rsquo;s normal standards. Together they read.\nGirls,\nI know you were expecting me home this evening, and it pains me to write this letter to you rather than be there with you both. Unfortunately the pain my heart must endure does not stop there. It is time you both knew the truth. About your \u0026lsquo;father\u0026rsquo;. Years ago, I was living in a keep with a number of companions that I adventured with regularly. We struck out often into the unknown wilderness in search of whatever there was to be found. Riches, knowledge, new sights, whatever took our fancy. One of these adventurers was an elven Wizardess named Kilishandra. Kilishandra Thorindal.  Katrina and Riana looked up at one another suddenly. \u0026ldquo;Thorindal. Dad?\u0026rdquo; Riana said.\n\u0026ldquo;No.\u0026rdquo; Katrina replied. \u0026ldquo;That can\u0026rsquo;t be right. She said this Kilishandra was a wizardESS. Not a wizard!\u0026rdquo;\nThey stared at one another for a moment and then looked back to the letter.\nKilishandra and I shared many adventures together. As the best of friends. But there was something different in her soul. Something that I never would have expected until I watched her beat down the defenses of a castle single handedly, in order to profess her love, for another of the women that lived and adventured with us. I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what to think or do about her after that day. I tried to stay close to her but I wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure my heart could go where I thought she may eventually try and tread. Apparently our other friend felt the same as me, for she distanced herself from Kilishandra, and soon after, became engaged with a wonderful man, whom she eventually married and bore children with. Kilishandra was happy for them both, but I could see that she was crushed. So I spent more time with her, trying to keep her thoughts from the past. Eventually, years later, we encountered a Dark elf with a special mission. He buried a cursed dagger in Kilishandra\u0026rsquo;s ribs and disappeared, sobbing something about being sorry. I rushed her to our healer, who quickly dealt with the physical wound, but she did not get better. She lay in a fevered sleep for days, and whenever we tried to rouse her, she would scream obscenities and try to hurt us. So we had a healer keep her in a deep slumber while we tried to figure out what had happened.\nEventually, we discovered, through a series of events that leads me to believe the entire ordeal was very much orchestrated, that the dagger was a cursed weapon that would slowly open her mind to the powers of hate and discord. She would slowly become a being of evil and hatred unless we could do something. What\u0026rsquo;s more, the Dark elf that stabbed her with the thing turned out to be the reincarnated first love of Kilishandra, whom had died hundreds of years prior, and now it seemed, had been called back and was being controlled by a powerful mage of unknown origins. The elf, Rhaeton, confessed that he was obliged to tell us his master\u0026rsquo;s name, and said that it was Wyndel. While our friends fanned out in search of this Wyndel, I decided to see if the curse of the dagger could be broken if the dagger itself was broken. But in trying to destroy the thing, I pricked my finger with it, thus cursing myself to the same fate as Kilishandra.\nAfter a time, our mages contrived a ritual that they said had a high probability of success in curing both Kilishandra and myself of the curse, but we had to act immediately, and it was a very dangerous thing to attempt. It involved the merging of our minds, along with a third person\u0026rsquo;s. Their thinking was that, together we could chase out, or seal off the cursed parts of our minds, and then balance what was left, filling in gaps and holes from one another\u0026rsquo;s minds. In effect, after the ritual, we would all be ourselves, but each of us would carry bits of the others within us. I agreed, as did the woman that had been the object of Kilishandra\u0026rsquo;s affections years before, so we set up the ritual and performed it immediately.\nI can not to this day describe the experience. But when it was over, it had worked. Almost perfectly. Kilishandra woke from a months long slumber, a changed person. But then so were the rest of us. I found that the pieces of her that had stayed with me, helped me understand her feelings, her confusion, her uncertainty in how she felt, and WHAT she felt. I knew in my mind that I could never have considered it possible before, but then, after the ritual, after the sharing, and baring of our souls to one another, I could not deny it. I HAD grown to love her in our time together, and although she had been trying hard to subdue her feelings, especially after what had happened to her the last time she shared them, I KNEW that she loved me. So, we went down that path, together.\nI wish that I could say that we had years of happiness together after that day. But it was not to be. After a few brief days, she discovered who Wyndel was, and where he had secreted himself away. It seems that he was her estranged father, driven mad with power lust over centuries spent in its pursuit. He had struck a deal with a demon to provide it the perfect vessel with which to wreak havoc on the world in exchange for some ultimate power, and to that end he had brought back the soul of Rhaeton and had it strike down his own daughter. She snuck away from our bed in the dead of night and went to him to finish it. She left a note that I discovered when I roused at the realization that she was not with me that night. I could not have gotten to them in time if I had grown wings and flown. Although, gods know, I was close. I arrived just as the final blows were struck. Kilishandra and Wyndel destroyed each other before my eyes. My love lay dying in my arms and there was nothing I could do to stop it.\nWith her dying breath she professed her love to me, and pushed a parchment into my hands before closing her eyes for what should have been the last time. The parchment was a love letter of sorts, and directions to where she had hidden an amulet of her own creation. The amulet was enchanted with bits of her being in such a way that the first woman to don it about her neck would conceive a child, born of her and Kilishandra\u0026rsquo;s bodies and souls.\nI kept it secret. Hidden for years. I feared what my life would become. Not just in the having of children, but in the having of children with no father, but two mothers. I feared for what people would think of me. And of what they would think of my children. But after decades, my heart still ached for her. I longed for her touch. Her breath upon my flesh. I missed her so much that I decided that I would have a living piece of her in my life no matter what others thought of it. So I donned the amulet, and waited.\nNot long after, the two of you came to me. I gave birth to you and it was the greatest miracle in my life. I raised you both as best I could, telling you all the while that your father had been killed in some great battle. I never had the courage to tell you the truth, for fear of what you, my children, would think of me. Know that I love you and that I have always loved you. You are both the products of pure love. A love between two people that could not be broken, not by curse, not by time, and certainly not by the prying eyes of other people.\nI know that this must come as a shock to you both, but I had to tell you before I set you down the path that you must now follow. I am sorry that it is the two of you that must now complete the cycle of the curse that tried to destroy Kilishandra and myself all those years ago. If I could do it myself, I would, but it can not be me that does it. When I said that the ritual almost worked, I meant it. There was an unfortunate consequence. Some time after the ritual, the third woman, an elf by the name of Ambrai, began to follow a dark path. Long a Ranger of the wilds, she began to turn towards the dark magics, forsaking her roots in the forests and the wilds. She began to play with necromancy, and before long had exhumed the body of my Kilishandra and reanimated it to do her bidding. She caused much strife in the world before she was inexorably drawn to the dark side of the mountains, where the undead and demons of Kalijor roam free. I know she was hurt by Kilishandra, and I know she saw into her heart that day. I can forgive her, even for the desecration of Kilishandra\u0026rsquo;s grave, but she is getting worse. I have long heard rumors of a dark ranger that roams the Plane of Sorrow and preys upon adventurers there. Recently I overheard someone that had seen her, talking about the amulet that this dark ranger wore about her neck, and I know it to be the very one that gave the two of you life. The one I buried with Kilishandra after you were born.\nI did some research into some of Kilishandra\u0026rsquo;s journals and spell books and it seems that one of the spells she used in creating that amulet was an ancient spell of life, from before the great wars. I further researched the spell in the academy library and discovered that it has a dark potential when used as an enchantment. After it is expended, it can be recharged, through the infusion of soul energy. It takes hundreds of souls to replenish the power of the amulet, but the nature of the life created by it is directly proportional to the way in which the soul energy is harvested. Kilishandra filled it with all of her love for me, and blessed me with the two of you. And, I believe, because of the nature of your conception, your being born almost solely from magic, the two of you have come to surpass almost every mage in Kalijor, even at your young age. But I fear Ambrai, in her travels down the path of evil, now fills the amulet with a dark energy. If she were to conceive a child, born of that energy, and with your aptitude for wielding it, it would be a monster.\nI am currently deep in the Burning Expanse, searching the catacombs here for some means to destroy the amulet. But it is to the two of you that I must entrust the task of collecting it. I have no idea how Ambrai will react to the two of you but I can imagine that it will not be pleasant, and I know that your experience will be difficult. You may have to fight her. Or even kill her. And it is very likely that she still commands the body of your mother, Kilishandra. Please understand that she is long since dead. If you must destroy her body, know that it is just that, her body. Her soul was freed decades ago, and all that remains is a husk.\nGo first to Pandoria, and fetch a reliquary from the druid circle there. It should help you when dealing with Ambrai. I have sent a message there warning them of your coming and your needs. Then visit Gornin in Cohai, and ask him how best to proceed. He knows of your quest and will be ready to receive you.\nKatrina. Riana. My loves. My life. I am very sorry for this thing that I have asked you to do. I would do it myself, but the part of my mind and soul that is Ambrai\u0026rsquo;s would not allow it of me. So it is to the two of you that this task must fall. I am truly sorry girls. I love you both more than life itself.\nYour loving mother,\nEzrina Thorindal\n  The girls looked at one another after finishing the letter. No words were said, but the exchange ran deep. Their whole world had just changed. In the blink of an eye, the reading of a letter, everything they knew was different.\n\u0026ldquo;Get some rest.\u0026rdquo; Riana said to her sister as she stood up and slowly padded down the short hall towards her bedchamber. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;ll leave in the morning.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina stared after her sister as she moved down the hall, closing the door behind her.\nOn to Chapter 3\n"

	"content": "Kalijor is the product of a lot of dreaming, a lot of hard work, and a lot of fun times. I conceived the world of Kalijor after nearly ten years of role playing with my friends through school. I loved the games we played but I quickly grew tired of trying to fit my own ideas inside the framework of the world settings that the source books offered. That and I wanted to have a better reason to tell my friends that they couldn\u0026rsquo;t play that uber evil-smashing mega knight deluxe character, and setting them in my own world with specifically allowable character types seemed the best way to go and make everyone fall in with a minimum of fuss.\nSo Kalijor was born. Only not as Kalijor. Initially, and for a number of years I called it Jade. Kalijor was actually the name of a magical weapon found by the players in the world of Jade. Well as I began to flesh out the world and it started taking on a life of its own, I began to think about the possibility of some form of publication and the name Jade is used quite a bit by other folks in the fantasy realm. I wanted, no NEEDED a name for my world that was really unique and sounded cool at the same time. So I upgraded the magical weapon to an entire world (heck of a promotion if I do say so myself).\nFrom that point it just sort of took off on its own. New characters were created, the local governments and politics began to take shape and before I knew it I was pounding away at the keyboard daily (or almost daily) until I eventually found myself here, building this site to support, and promote the novels, the WORLD of Kalijor!\n"

	"content": "\u0026ldquo;All I\u0026rsquo;m saying is that an \u0026rsquo;in-flight meal\u0026rsquo; is more than just a package of peanuts and half a can of Coke,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot groused. The small but surprisingly strong hand of the flight attendant tightened on her shoulder and a quick shove moved the assassin faster down the boarding hallway from the plane toward the terminal at Denver International Airport. \u0026ldquo;If you don\u0026rsquo;t want to get sued for false advertising, you should change the brochure.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you for the input, ma\u0026rsquo;am. I\u0026rsquo;ll pass it along to management.\u0026rdquo; The flight attendant\u0026rsquo;s response slithered past her, dripping with the venom of someone who has been dealing with too many people for far too long on entirely too little sleep.\n\u0026ldquo;Forgive her, please,\u0026rdquo; Bennu responded with a bored drawl, her words dripping with sarcasm from farther back where even her longer legs were having trouble keeping up with the hurried pace of the flight attendant and her charge. \u0026ldquo;She\u0026rsquo;s so smart she thinks everyone should just listen to her and do what she says and that would make the world a better place.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It totally would,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot announced. \u0026ldquo;And it\u0026rsquo;s so nice to finally keep the company of someone who realizes that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That was sarcasm, Ocelot,\u0026rdquo; Bennu groaned.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you for flying Terminus Airlines,\u0026rdquo; the irate flight attendant announced as they crossed over the threshold of the boarding hallway into the terminal. As she spoke, she released Ocelot\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, giving the scantily clad woman a little extra push. The look on her face when Ocelot turned around to speak to her again was one of exasperation. Or it might have been disappointment at the fact that her extra push had not launched the annoying woman headlong across the terminal and out one of the opposite windows to land face first on the tarmac and be promptly run over by some piece of large equipment there.\n\u0026ldquo;You know, as much as I appreciate you saying that, it doesn\u0026rsquo;t really sound sincere to me,\u0026rdquo; the assassin began, raising a finger to point at the woman. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m going to have to mention that in my online review of your performance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why you little\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; The woman started to step forward, hands clenched into fists of anger, when Bennu\u0026rsquo;s larger hand gently wrapped over her shoulder, stopping her.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you again for your understanding and patience,\u0026rdquo; Bennu began, moving up next to the woman and giving Ocelot a frustrated glance before composing her face into a sweet smile and turning it on the irate attendant. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll make sure the review is appropriate, please don\u0026rsquo;t worry.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think we\u0026rsquo;re past that,\u0026rdquo; the woman growled, intentionally narrowing her eyes and ignoring Bennu\u0026rsquo;s look to stare past her at Ocelot.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m very sorry,\u0026rdquo; Bennu continued to try and calm the attendant.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot chimed in. \u0026ldquo;Sorry you don\u0026rsquo;t understand the concept of customer service. Twelve dollars for some peanuts and half a Coke? I\u0026rsquo;m wealthy beyond the dreams of Avarice and even I couldn\u0026rsquo;t afford those prices. I mean, if I charged my customers on that scale I\u0026rsquo;d have to charge\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; She stopped for a minute, her eyes losing focus as she ran some numbers in her head, then looked back at the other women and finished. \u0026ldquo;\u0026mdash;six thousand two-hundred and eighty seven dollars per bullet. Nobody would pay those rates. I\u0026rsquo;d be destitute in no time. I\u0026rsquo;d have to find a normal-person job doing normal-person things.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe it would teach you some normal-person people skills,\u0026rdquo; the attendant growled. She tried to step toward Ocelot but Bennu\u0026rsquo;s hand on her shoulder grew firmer and held her in place.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;Pu-lease,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot rolled her eyes. \u0026ldquo;I could do your job in a New York minute.\u0026rdquo; By way of demonstration, she put on her best Barbie face and struck a pose, thrusting her hips to one side at a jaunty angle and thrusting her breasts forward. \u0026ldquo;Excuse me, sir. The Captain has turned on the fasten seat belts sign, which means you need to turn off all your electronic devices, even though there\u0026rsquo;s no legitimate evidence to indicate they can have any effect whatsoever on flight operations or vehicle safety.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Why you!\u0026rdquo; The woman pushed harder on Bennu\u0026rsquo;s firming grip, to the point that the mage had to lean forward a bit to keep the smaller woman in place. Not to be deterred, however, the woman twisted around, breaking Bennu\u0026rsquo;s connection with her shoulder and quickly ducking under her arm as the lack of resistance caused the mage to stumble forward, trying to catch her balance. She took two steps toward Ocelot, one hand outstretched toward the assassin\u0026rsquo;s throat and the other cocked back in a fist, ready to strike.\u0026nbsp;\nThe space went suddenly quiet as Bennu caught her balance and spun around, eyes widening at what she saw. Ocelot stood there, calm as the eye of a hurricane, one hand casually holding one hand around the flight attendant\u0026rsquo;s throat, gently squeezing it from either side, the other on one of her holstered weapons. The assassin\u0026rsquo;s face was somewhere between calm and elated, with the beginnings of a maniacal grin twitching at the corners of her mouth and a twinkle in her golden eyes. The flight attendant had frozen in place, arms held in mid air and her breathing coming in slow, careful pulls, trying not to aggravate the situation.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; Bennu groaned. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s exactly how to handle the situation. Ocelot, let her go this instant.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No skin off my neck,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot breathed, the smile finally spreading across her lips. As if nothing had happened, she took a step back from the frightened woman. Her hands moved to her hips and she stood there grinning, arms akimbo and tail twitching while the flight attendant deflated, retreating away from her.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re friend\u0026rsquo;s a real psychopath, you know that?\u0026rdquo; the woman mustered the courage to spit at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Sociopath, actually!\u0026rdquo; Ocelot called back at her from farther down the concourse.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry,\u0026rdquo; Bennu frowned, turning toward Ocelot and jogging to catch up. \u0026ldquo;Seriously?\u0026rdquo; she grumbled, moving up alongside her companion and matching her pace. \u0026ldquo;All of that, over a package of peanuts?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Peanuts aren\u0026rsquo;t a meal,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shrugged.\n\u0026ldquo;And how did you even get all of your weapons past security?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Most people can\u0026rsquo;t see them, remember?\u0026rdquo; she shrugged again.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking that airport security has the ability to see through enchantments. Even good ones.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I have a permit?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot tried, raising an eye at her companion.\n\u0026ldquo;Just as likely as the previous statement,\u0026rdquo; Bennu confirmed with a sigh. \u0026ldquo;So, you aren\u0026rsquo;t going to tell me then.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Isn\u0026rsquo;t it nice to have a little mystery in your life?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot beamed.\n\u0026ldquo;You know, when I decided to stay away from the conservancy and spend some more time with you, I really didn\u0026rsquo;t think it would be like babysitting an ornery preteen. Plus, I\u0026rsquo;m really not okay with just killing people.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You still haven\u0026rsquo;t killed anyone, unless you\u0026rsquo;ve been doing it while I\u0026rsquo;m asleep,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot corrected.\n\u0026ldquo;This isn\u0026rsquo;t going how I\u0026rsquo;d hoped at all. Suddenly, I\u0026rsquo;ve got a job, bills, a disrespecting, angsty preteen of my own.\u0026rdquo; She motioned at Ocelot as she spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh, ha ha,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot snorted. \u0026ldquo;Anyway, welcome to the real world.\u0026rdquo; She shrugged, stopping outside a lounge and fixing her eyes on a television where a newscaster was talking about something to do with an escaped mage who had somehow broken free of a Quanta facility and was last seen entering the city. They were too far away to hear the audio, but the lounge staff had turned on the subtitles so they could read what was being said from the concourse hallway.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;still unsure as to the reasons for her flight to Denver, if she is indeed here. This footage taken during her escape from custody shows the mage supremacist\u0026rsquo;s utter disregard for human life.\u0026rdquo; The station rolled footage in a picture window next to the announcer, showing the obsidian form of what could only be described as a force of nature tossing people around without touching them and snakelike black tendrils sucking the life out of people in seconds. \u0026ldquo;Authorities warn the public not to approach or attempt to restrain her. If you have any information on Sardonia\u0026rsquo;s whereabouts, contact Quanta at the email address or phone number below.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot called out to one of the lounge patrons. A few people looked their direction and she pointed at one, asking, \u0026ldquo;When did that happen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A few days ago,\u0026rdquo; he responded. \u0026ldquo;If you just arrived, you might want to get back on your plane, \u0026rsquo;cause it looks like the authorities are going to make this one take a while.\u0026rdquo;\nGrunting in his direction, Ocelot turned, nearly walked into Bennu, who was standing nearby watching the newscast with wide eyes. Looking her companion up and down, the assassin shook her head, stepping around her and marching off again. Bennu took a moment to stare at a few scenes of damage caused by the mage\u0026rsquo;s escape, cringing at images of the dark-skinned, rainbow-haired woman, superimposed over scenes of damaged buildings, collapsed walls, and sinkholes in roads, before turning and trotting after Ocelot.\n\u0026ldquo;You look like you\u0026rsquo;ve seen a ghost,\u0026rdquo; Bennu said, drawing up next to the assassin, who was uncharacteristically quiet as they walked. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s bugging you?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nothing,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot replied, not even trying to conceal the fact that she was obviously bothered.\n\u0026ldquo;Should we look into it somehow?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not my circus, not my monkeys.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s not very compassionate.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Um, assassin, remember?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot pointed at herself with both of her thumbs, stepping onto the underground train car that would take them back to the main building of the airport.\n\u0026ldquo;I can\u0026rsquo;t take this constant vigilance, Ocelot,\u0026rdquo; Bennu sighed. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s, like, being on guard to stop a disaster every waking moment. I\u0026rsquo;m exhausted.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You should get some rest then. You haven\u0026rsquo;t been sleeping well.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I haven\u0026rsquo;t been sleeping well because I\u0026rsquo;m constantly watching you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I can appreciate that,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot nodded. \u0026ldquo;I am a sexy beast.\u0026rdquo;\nBennu groaned, rolling her eyes and sagging into the wall of the train. She pressed her fingers into the bridge of her nose and took a deep, calming breath to steady her nerves. For a moment, the faint rumbling of what sounds like the dragon language rolled from her barely-moving lips. At last, she let out a deep breath and tried again, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m trying to tell you something, Ocelot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So, stop trying and just tell me already,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot responded, turning toward the door as it opened again. \u0026ldquo;Shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be so difficult.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And yet\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; Bennu grumbled, launching herself off the wall and following her companion out onto the platform.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;re making excuses,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot continued, walking up the escalator as if it were a set of stairs. Halfway up, she ran into a couple who were standing on the moving stairs, obviously in no rush, and cleared her throat loudly. When they looked back at her, she motioned toward the top of the stairs expectantly, then squeezed between them when they moved almost imperceptibly. She reached the top of the escalator mere seconds before the couple, who were rightfully upset and casting her disparaging looks as they stepped off and pointedly took the long way around the landing to avoid further interactions.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m so sorry,\u0026rdquo; Bennu called after the pair, moving up behind Ocelot and wincing at the glowers they tossed back her way. \u0026ldquo;This is what I\u0026rsquo;m talking about,\u0026rdquo; she said to the assassin.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it isn\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shook her head. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re talking about everything except what you want to talk about. Because you\u0026rsquo;re afraid.\u0026rdquo; Her tone was serious, for once, as they moved onto the next train platform, watching as the light rail cars moved into view, slowing to a stop in front of them. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re afraid. Of me. Of what I do. And of what being around me for too long will turn you into.\u0026rdquo;\nOcelot fixed her gold eyes on her companion\u0026rsquo;s storm-cloud grey eyes and kept them there long enough for Bennu to see that she did, in fact, know what she was talking about. That had been exactly what she\u0026rsquo;d been trying to say since they\u0026rsquo;d landed in Indianapolis.\n\u0026ldquo;Ocelot, I\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; she started to say, but the assassin cut her off.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay, Bennu. It\u0026rsquo;s for the best, really. I\u0026rsquo;m an assassin. I\u0026rsquo;m not going to stop being who I am any more than you could. And I think it should be pretty obvious by now that I\u0026rsquo;m no good with relationships of any kind. I\u0026rsquo;m better off on my own, and you\u0026rsquo;re better off with people you can reason with. This\u0026mdash;\u0026rdquo; She gestured between the two of them with a wave of her hand. \u0026ldquo;This was never going to work out.\u0026rdquo;\nShrugging, Ocelot took a backward step onto the light rail, waving as the door closed in front of her, cutting the pair off and leaving Bennu on the platform as the cars accelerated away.\nShe watched the platform, and her best friend in the entire world receded away from her into the distance, wiping a single, solitary tear from her face as she did so, then turned away from the scene, holding onto the rail near the door for stability as the car accelerated coming out of a turn.\n\u0026ldquo;Man, that was harsh,\u0026rdquo; a voice whispered in her direction. Her yellow eyes snapped toward the sound, landing on the face of a cat-like person sitting on one of the side benches. Big, feline eyes fixed on her standing by the door.\n\u0026ldquo;Listening to that, were you?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot purred, raising an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Kinda hard not to overhear,\u0026rdquo; the felinoid responded, whiskers twitching.\n\u0026ldquo;Then I assume you also heard the part about me being an assassin?\u0026rdquo; Ocelot asked, turning to face the cat. A slender knife appeared in her hand, held behind her leg where nobody on the car could see it. She took a half step toward the stranger, then stopped when her phone began to play the tune People are Strange by The Doors. \u0026ldquo;Hold that thought.\u0026rdquo; She held up a finger at the cat person, disappearing her knife once more and retrieving her phone from some unknown location on her person. \u0026ldquo;Jeshi, what\u0026rsquo;s up?\u0026rdquo; she asked the device.\nJeshi was the owner of Lyrica Magica, an old church that had been converted into a club that hosted people of every stripe. And, while anyone was welcome, the club tended to be seen as more of a hangout for mages and anthropomorphs, people who had used magic to change themselves into elves, ogres, trolls, or any number of other beings, like the cat-person still looking at her from the other side of the train. Jeshi was also an immortal, and a powerful seer, with the ability to look into the future and see what it held. More often than not, he used his power to help steer humanity away from disastrous potential futures, but the cost of doing so often meant that much smaller disasters, both personal and otherwise, befell himself and those around him. This was why he tended to keep most people at arm\u0026rsquo;s length and not make too many personal connections.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s time,\u0026rdquo; Jeshi said, his voice carrying an edge of uncertainty. Which, in itself, was reason enough for Ocelot to be concerned.\nJeshi was a generally calm, intelligent, and introspective person whose abilities didn\u0026rsquo;t reside merely in the metaphysical or financial areas of his life. He was a man who commanded so much respect, on so many levels, and from so many communities, that no sane person would ever dare start a fight in his club for fear of incurring his wrath. And the one time she\u0026rsquo;d seen someone bring a fight to his doorstep, Ocelot had watched him draw a sword from his cane and wade into a tsunami of summoned, slavering, tooth-and-claw bearing naga as if it were the most normal thing in the world. The man had stood in front of a flood of supernatural monsters from another dimension and not once had he wavered. Instead, he had forged ahead, fighting off one monster after another to ensure his employees and his clients were all safe and accounted for.\u0026nbsp;\nAnd she owed him a favor.\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m calling in my marker,\u0026rdquo; he added.\nFor starting a fight in his club.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m on my way,\u0026rdquo; she responded. The line went dead and she returned her phone to whence it had come, before looking back at the feline form across from her. \u0026ldquo;Looks like you get to keep however many lives you\u0026rsquo;ve still got on file.\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "-Chapter 1-\nOcelot stood among a small horde of armed people, most of whom were a good six inches taller than her, and an easy eighty pounds heavier. The air was heavy with the smell of sweat, testosterone, and gun oil. Her nose twitched at the offensive combination of odors, but she stubbornly refused to scratch at it. Instead, she stood tall, shoulders squared, fists on her narrow hips, and twisted her mouth into an appropriate scowl.\n\u0026ldquo;My name is Ocelot. Not Cougar.\u0026rdquo; She honestly had no idea why the name thing was so difficult for people or, for that matter, where the nom de plume of \u0026lsquo;the Cougar\u0026rsquo; had come from in the first place. What she did know was that she hated being called \u0026lsquo;the Cougar\u0026rsquo; with all one-hundred ten pounds of her sinewy, martial artist\u0026rsquo;s body.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you aren\u0026rsquo;t the Cougar?\u0026rdquo; the man opposite her in the throng of people asked, raising an eyebrow. The gesture seemed odd, and drew attention to his bad eye, scarred and milky white from some form of damage.\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; she spat. \u0026ldquo;Ocelot. My name is Ocelot. It isn\u0026rsquo;t even hard to say.\u0026rdquo; Her nose twitched again. This time she scrunched her face for the briefest of moments to try and ward off the olfactory assault without looking foolish. One must not appear weak in front of one\u0026rsquo;s potential clients.\n\u0026ldquo;So,\u0026rdquo; the man continued, putting on his best thoughtful look. \u0026ldquo;You aren\u0026rsquo;t the assassin who killed Adrian Malcone out in Englewood a few months back? While he was sealed inside his panic room and surrounded by two dozen armed men?\u0026rdquo;\nOcelot\u0026rsquo;s nose twitch turned into a feral grin at the mention of Malcone\u0026rsquo;s demise. That had been a fun job to pull off. \u0026ldquo;Of course, that was me,\u0026rdquo; she purred.\n\u0026ldquo;So, you are the Cougar,\u0026rdquo; he inferred.\n\u0026ldquo;No. There is no Cougar. I\u0026rsquo;m Ocelot. That was my work. Me. Myself. I. The one and only. The incomparable Ocelot!\u0026rdquo; She stopped just shy of thumping her chest with pride at the exclamation.\n\u0026ldquo;But the Cougar did that job. Everyone knows that,\u0026rdquo; the man\u0026rsquo;s face soured. \u0026ldquo;And I need the one who did that job to do this job. So, if you aren\u0026rsquo;t the cougar\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;There. Is. No. Cougar.\u0026rdquo; Ocelot growled, fingers flexing as she tried not to grab at her weapons and prove how wrong the lot of them were. \u0026ldquo;Ocelot. That\u0026rsquo;s me. I did the Malcone job.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Easy,\u0026rdquo; she beamed, throwing a little rakish cant to her hips. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m awesome.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But you aren\u0026rsquo;t the Cougar?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh,\u0026rdquo; she spat. \u0026ldquo;Look, goofy-eye-guy. Either you want me for this job, or you don\u0026rsquo;t. You can go on looking for the Cougar if you like, but you\u0026rsquo;ll never find her, because she doesn\u0026rsquo;t exist. Never has. So, what\u0026rsquo;s the deal? Who do you want put down?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How dare you talk to him like that!\u0026rdquo; A man to her right started forward menacingly, his arms outstretched.\nOcelot stepped to the left, grabbed the man\u0026rsquo;s arm with her right hand, and pulled hard in a downward circle, toppling him over her outstretched foot so he landed on his back, right on top of a handful of poisoned caltrops she\u0026rsquo;d dropped with her free hand when she\u0026rsquo;d started moving. The man convulsed a few times, foam forming at the corners of his mouth, then expired with a rattling gasp, arms going limp at his sides. \u0026ldquo;Oh, crap,\u0026rdquo; she blushed, looking down at the corpse. \u0026ldquo;Sorry about that. He looked like he was going to get kind\u0026rsquo;a hands-y with me. I have kind of a knee-jerk reaction to hands-y folk.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He was one of my best,\u0026rdquo; the man with the scarred eye breathed, mouth agape.\n\u0026ldquo;If you say so.\u0026rdquo; Ocelot shrugged, looking down at the dead man to see if there was anything special about him.\n\u0026ldquo;So, do you want this other guy killed, or what? I could be out clubbing right now, you know. I got this bitch\u0026rsquo;n outfit and everything. Striking another pose, she thrust her chest out to emphasize her small-ish breasts. Her tight top and short, flouncy skirt set off her dark tan and displayed the spots of her namesake tattooed up her back and sides. The bolero jacket she wore covered her shoulders and arms, but not much else. Her tail dangled behind her, twitching with every movement, and her below-the-knee boots, with their practical heels, completely failed to jingle with the movement, despite the fact that they were covered in zippers, buckles, and glittering chrome chains. Her short, platinum hair let everyone know that her spots went all the way up the back of her bare neck, but long locks dangled down below her shoulders from around her temples to make sure she still had a girlish flare about her. At the top of her head, her hair rose up on either side, looking like the ears of a predatory cat, giving folks enough to think that maybe they were her real ears, since her hair completely covered her actual ears. Her amber eyes burned brilliantly in the relative darkness of the packed room and her nose twitched again at the greasy smell of men on high-protein diets, utterly destroying her hero pose.\nNot to mention the fact that everyone present was clearly more interested in her body, or the body on the floor, than they were concerned about how amazing her outfit or pose were. Rubbing some sass on her next words, Ocelot dropped one hand to the handle of the pistol strapped to her thigh and tapped it impatiently. \u0026ldquo;Hey. Eye-guy!\u0026rdquo; She snapped her fingers in front of his eyes, drawing him back from his day-dream state. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the job?\u0026rdquo;\nThe man blinked a few times, then looked down at his dead companion and back at her, being careful to meet her eyes this time. \u0026ldquo;Aidelon Ferro,\u0026rdquo; he announced. He\u0026rsquo;s up north, in Superior. He\u0026rsquo;s got\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yawn!\u0026rdquo; she silenced him. \u0026ldquo;Say, are you sure about this decorating scheme?\u0026rdquo; The man looked at her, mouth hanging open again as she pointed to the dreary walls and the decades-old, tattered drapes that hung over the windows. \u0026ldquo;I think the seventies might sue you for cribbing their style. And doing it so badly.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; He gaped. The rest of the men looked around, trying to figure out what she was talking about.\n\u0026ldquo;Seriously,\u0026rdquo; she tisked. \u0026ldquo;With all this testosterone you\u0026rsquo;ve got in here, I would think maybe some darker colors. Neon beer signs. Do you even ~have~ a pool table in this shit-hole?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t,\u0026rdquo; the man stammered, then shook his head and tried to get back on track. \u0026ldquo;Aidelon is the kingpin of the northern\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;My ex always said that any group of thugs like this should have a nice pool table. You know. Something to pass the time while you\u0026rsquo;re not out breaking kneecaps or swindling orphans or whatever.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure you\u0026rsquo;re the one who pulled off the Malcone job?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I said I was, didn\u0026rsquo;t I?\u0026rdquo; She groused, frowning at him. \u0026ldquo;We\u0026rsquo;re going to be here all night if you keep asking the same questions over and over and over and over and over\u0026hellip; Hey! Is that the new Q-Phone 8ES?\u0026rdquo; Her eyes went wide as she danced past the corpse to crowd in next to a man at the back of the horde, pushing her way through the other stalky bodies to look down on the phone\u0026rsquo;s screen. The entire room watched her move, an air of confusion following in her wake.\n\u0026ldquo;Er\u0026hellip; Yes?\u0026rdquo; The young man holding the phone responded.\n\u0026ldquo;How\u0026rsquo;s the new DAC? I\u0026rsquo;ve been thinking of getting one, but I really want my music to sound right. Ocelot needs her music when she\u0026rsquo;s out killing and if it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound right it throws off her groove.\u0026rdquo; She shimmied a bit, demonstrating how awesome her dance moves were.\n\u0026ldquo;Are you even listening to me?\u0026rdquo; The man with the scarred eye blanched.\n\u0026ldquo;Not really,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot rolled her eyes. \u0026ldquo;~So~ boring.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well, if you\u0026rsquo;ll let me finish, you can stop being bored and go get the job done. As I was saying, Aidelon has at least forty men\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Boring,\u0026rdquo; Ocelot cut him off again, yawning dramatically. \u0026ldquo;How about money. You know my rates, right?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes,\u0026rdquo; he groaned, producing a smart phone and pulling up an app to show her. \u0026ldquo;We put the quarter-million in escrow, just like you said. As soon as the job is done, it\u0026rsquo;s yours.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Perfect!\u0026rdquo; Ocelot beamed, eyes shining at the sight of the account balance. \u0026ldquo;Ocelot loves getting paid!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right,\u0026rdquo; he looked at her, a bit of concern showing on his face. \u0026ldquo;So, about Aidelon\u0026rsquo;s place\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ugh,\u0026rdquo; she cut him off again. \u0026ldquo;Why are you ~so~ boring? That\u0026rsquo;s it. I\u0026rsquo;m out of here.\u0026rdquo; She waived his protest off, rolling her eyes at him, and turned on the spot, smacking his shins with the tip of her tail. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ma go kill this Alphonse guy so you\u0026rsquo;ll shut up and pay me my money.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Aidelon,\u0026rdquo; the man corrected to her back.\n\u0026ldquo;Abbadon,\u0026rdquo; she said, still moving toward the door.\n\u0026ldquo;Aidelon!\u0026rdquo; he shouted.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright!\u0026rdquo; she shouted back. \u0026ldquo;Abraham. Whatever!\u0026rdquo; Holding her hand up toward him, fingers spread wide, she spared a glance over her shoulder at the stunned room full of thugs. \u0026ldquo;Just get ready to pay me.\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "-2- Fifteen minutes later, en route to meet his contact and drop off the data he\u0026rsquo;d recovered, his comm link chirped out that he was being contacted on a secure line. Grinning, Darren put the comm link in his ear and ran the short ODN cable dangling from it into the head jack, allowing his onboard computer to decrypt the signal. Contacting him while he was still on the job meant a priority assignment, and a priority assignment meant priority pay. His grin turned into a wolfish smile as he keyed up the comm and answered the line.\n\u0026ldquo;Go for ninety-nine,\u0026rdquo; he said.\n\u0026ldquo;Priority one acquisition. Physical materials in transit. Movement is supposed to be clandestine, so guard response should be minimal,\u0026rdquo; the mechanical voice announced.\nDarren grunted at the job description. He preferred to only work with digital commodities as physical objects made it difficult for him to move as freely as he liked, especially when making an escape from the scene of a crime he\u0026rsquo;d just committed. Still, a priority one job on no notice meant huge dividends.\n\u0026ldquo;Comp?\u0026rdquo;\nThere was a pause as the person or computer, it was impossible to tell which, on the other end of the line considered his question. At last the voice returned with, \u0026ldquo;Two point four million.\u0026rdquo;\nDarren sat up straight in his seat on the mono-rail, eyes wide. That much money would allow him to quit the company and go freelance. It could set him up for a life without having to work at all, if he handled it right. Not that he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t still freelance. \u0026ldquo;Package?\u0026rdquo; he asked, trying to cover up the lump of excitement in his throat.\n\u0026ldquo;Sealed canister,\u0026rdquo; the voice replied.\n\u0026ldquo;Dimensions?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Six inches in diameter, one foot long.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Delivery?\u0026rdquo; He raised an eyebrow. Two million credits for something that small was a lot of coin. Somehow, he suspected there would be more than minimal resistance, even if the object was being moved in secret.\n\u0026ldquo;Agent Three, location ZZ9PZA.\u0026rdquo;\nAgent Three was big-time. They\u0026rsquo;d finally called him for a big job. Darren\u0026rsquo;s grin receded a bit as he considered the ramifications of the call. Being optioned for something that big, and dropping the package with Agent Three meant one of two things. They had their eyes on him, which in and of itself could be good or bad depending on the scrutiny he was getting, or they wanted him out of the game and they were sending him on a fool\u0026rsquo;s errand to be killed. Still, he felt sure he could get himself out of any situation he might end up in as a result of taking the job. He\u0026rsquo;d been in the game long enough to know the tricks and traps he was likely to encounter. Plus, the two million credits meant he wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have to take any more jobs from Aegis Online ever again. At least, not if he didn\u0026rsquo;t want to.\n\u0026ldquo;Send the file,\u0026rdquo; he replied before he could talk himself out of it.\nThe line went dead and a moment later, his on board computer beeped in his ear again, signaling that the job information had been downloaded. Pulling the comm link from his ODN jack and stuffing it in his pocket, he produced his ODN patch cable again and ran it from his head jack to his wrist computer, calling up a holographic interface and accessing the hidden partition on his computer\u0026rsquo;s storage drive. In seconds he had a visual of the canister he was after as well as a detailed travel plan for the small convoy it would be on as it moved to its destination.\nIf the data provided was correct, and it almost always was, they were right. There were only two vehicles in the convoy, both lightly armored civilian vehicles, with only two guards and two drivers. The details of their route identified the ideal place to intercept and a quick glance at his current location told him he was mere minutes away from the appropriate station. With good luck he could be on site ten minutes before the convoy arrived and if the information was accurate, he had everything he needed to pull the job off with him.\nThe grin returned to his face as he paged through the rest of the file.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\nWatching from the roof of the two story building on the corner, Darren spotted the small convoy on its approach to the stop. It was the only major intersection on the travel route for the convoy, which meant the only mandatory stop due to traffic. While it was a busy street, it was also well after midnight, which meant the population in the street and on the roads was at its lowest and there would be very few people to witness either the convoy, or what Darren was about to do to it.\nThere were two vehicles, one coupe and one small van, both surface-effect hover vehicles with matte black paint jobs and windows that matched, allowing no visibility inside. Not that it mattered, there was no way Darren would even allow those inside to get out before he was long gone anyway.\nThe convoy moved closer to the intersection and Darren pulled the two tangler grenades out of his pockets, holding them with his thumbs hovering over the activation buttons. Watching with a critical eye for timing, he waited until they had just stopped at the corner, pressed the buttons, dropped the grenades, counted to three, then tipped himself over the edge as well, hands already withdrawing the next item in his bag of tricks as he fell.\n\u0026nbsp;\n\u0026ndash;Next Chapter\u0026ndash;\n"

His work as an industrial thief for Aegis Online certainly paid well enough, and allowed him to enjoy the kinds of freedoms that most people only dreamt of. But he still wanted out, as any bird in a gilded cage would. Fate, however, is a harsh mistress with a twisted sense of humor. On the verge of buying out his contract, he takes on one more job that should put him over the top and discovers the hard way that things like freedom, and Y chromosomes, should never be taken for granted. Now a guy stuck in a woman's body, he must track down the deadly Aegis Protocol that his former employer plans to use to attack the Kalijor game servers, and all of its players, while avoiding their agents, dealing with the new, and largely unwelcome, voice in his head, and keeping Xavier Quinn, the CEO of Solidarity Online, off his back. All while learning to deal with his new body, and all of the baggage that comes with it. Sample Chapters The sample chapters for The Aegis Protocol begin here.

	"content": "I will be playing a bit with this page until I get it settled in, but the intention is to post regular story ideas for the Kalijor RPG. I hope to give players quick access to story ideas, NPCs, and other information that will inspire, or completely facilitate campaigns and adventure ideas.\nPresentation of these ideas will be in a consistent style with a quick line or two to setup the situation, a description of the meat of the plot that will get characters engaged, and then a plot twist or turn that serves as the \u0026lsquo;big reveal\u0026rsquo; for the adventure. Any relevant NPCs or other world or equipment data will be provided below those three sections and the setting and any other pertinent technical information will be at the very top.\nThese adventure ideas are meant to serve in whatever capacity you deem fit, from complete packages intended to be played out in a single session to the starting points for epic campaign adventures that you and your group can run with for as long as you continue to enjoy them.\nPlease feel free to print and redistribute any of the information presented, but do please maintain any logos or copyright information that may be attached.\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\nA Simple Smash \u0026lsquo;n Grab\n  Setting: \u0026nbsp;The \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; world   Starting Location: \u0026nbsp;Neo-Tokyo, the office of one General Ferarco in a Quark Industries branch office.   Introduction: \u0026nbsp;The group has been assembled to break into a local Aegis Online facility and retrieve the specs for a new processor that AO has recently stolen.   Complication: \u0026nbsp;General Ferarco has asked the players to retrieve the specs from the AO main computer without killing any civilians and with minimal other loss of life. The facility is guarded by AO snipers outside and 1D4+4 soldiers inside and there are 1D6x10 civilian workers inside.   Twist: \u0026nbsp;The specs are being stored on a computer that is inside a hardened, separately locked room within the AO facility. The computer is not on the building\u0026rsquo;s network so the players must physically connect to it in order to fulfill their mission goal. The door locks for the room require the use of either a pick locks skill roll of 30 or an electrical engineering roll of 20 to open the lock and a hacking roll of 25 to open it.The room itself is guarded inside by 2 AO soldiers with assault rifles and heavy military armor.   Notes:     \u0026nbsp;\n  \u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\nLet\u0026rsquo;s go Visit the Woods\n  Setting: \u0026nbsp;Kalijor   Starting Location: \u0026nbsp;Rathalon   Introduction: \u0026nbsp;Returning to the city to wind down after a long adventure in the wilds of Kalijor, the group encounters a young child, stumbling up the road toward the west gate of the city, cheeks reddened with tears and body exhausted from a long flight.   Complication: \u0026nbsp;The child tells the players that they live with their family just inside the northern edge of the forest of Brume, less than a day\u0026rsquo;s journey from Rathalon. It seems his home was recently attacked by a pack of Scalerithica during their evening meal. The creatures battered down the door and poured through the windows, attacking everyone in sight. The child\u0026rsquo;s mother tossed him out one of the broken windows and told him to run so, without anywhere else to go, he headed for Rathalon hoping to find someone to help.   Twist: \u0026nbsp;There are 2D6+8 Scalerithica now residing within the child\u0026rsquo;s family home when the character\u0026rsquo;s arrive on site. The creatures have eaten everything in the house that isn\u0026rsquo;t nailed down or poisonous and a few dead creatures, bearing the signs of having been killed by weapons or magic, have also been mostly eaten by their living comrades.The creatures attack the characters on sight, defending their new home until only 1D4 remain, at which point they will attempt to retreat back into the deeper sections of the forest.\nThe child\u0026rsquo;s family managed to fight their way to the cellar entrance in their home and have been trapped there, beneath the house for days. They require some minor healing but are otherwise doing well and will offer to pay the characters their life\u0026rsquo;s savings of 2D6x100 gold coins for their assistance and the rescue of their child.   Notes: \u0026nbsp;The family are woodcutters who cut and trim young Brume trees along the northern edge of the forest. They have no idea why the creatures came out of the old forest and attacked them as they\u0026rsquo;ve been living there for years without any such incident occurring previously.    \u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\nNon Player Characters (NPCs) for the future setting\n\u0026nbsp;\nConglomerate Citizen\nThe average person on the street in Conglomerate territories. This person has a basic understanding of the world, their government, and generally considers anyone labeled as a Dissident to be a \u0026lsquo;badguy\u0026rsquo;. If they encounter a Dissident they will almost certainly alert the authorities, although most of them will not put themselves in harm\u0026rsquo;s way to stop a Dissident from doing whatever it is they are doing. Better to let Conglomerate officials deal with that sort of thing and stay out of the way.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 30\nAptitude: 30\nPersonality: 30\nStrength: 30\nAgility: 30\nAppearance: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 30\nMental Health: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nPilot: Rank 3\nRadio: Rank 2\nHand to Hand: Rank 1\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 0\nDodge: 1\nSkill: 0\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 0\nWeapons:\nNone\n\u0026nbsp;\nSecurity Guard\nThe average security guard is little more than a citizen with some extra training in the ways of basic hand to hand combat, weapon usage, and security procedures. These individuals can be found in most places of business at night, and occasionally during the day. Usually these are the first responders to trouble and while it is their job to deal with potential issues, most of them will do only what is necessary to get clear of the issue before reinforcements can arrive.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 30\nAptitude: 30\nPersonality: 30\nStrength: 35\nAgility: 35\nAppearance: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 35\nMental Health: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nHand to Hand: Rank 2\nRadio: Rank 2\nPilot: Rank 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 1\nDodge: 2\nSkill: 0\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 10\nWeapons:\nPistol: Damage 3D6 Physical Damage\n\u0026nbsp;\nConglomerate Soldier\nThis is your average Conglomerate grunt in the field. These soldiers have seen a few combat engagements but are by no means seasoned veterans. Conglomerate soldiers are generally true believers in what the Conglomerate stands for and will do everything they can to protect citizens, ensure that Dissidents are dealt with swiftly.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 35\nAptitude: 30\nPersonality: 30\nStrength: 40\nAgility: 35\nAppearance: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 40\nMental Health: 35\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nHand to Hand: Rank 3\nRadio: Rank 2\nPilot: Rank 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 2\nDodge: 2\nSkill: 1\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 15\nWeapons:\nSub-Machine Gun: Damage 1D4x10 Physical Damage\nPistol: Damage 3D6 Physical Damage\n\u0026nbsp;\nDissident Guerrilla\nThese are the militants that have chosen to take up arms against the Conglomerate and engage their soldiers in open combat. Guerrillas are experienced warriors, often with years of combat under their belts and hardened bodies, accustomed to the rigors of a war on the fringes of society. These warriors have taken up the cause of liberating humanity from the oppressive regime of the Conglomerate.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 40\nAptitude: 35\nPersonality: 25\nStrength: 45\nAgility: 40\nAppearance: 25\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 50\nMental Health: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nHand to Hand: Rank 3\nRadio: Rank 2\nPilot: Rank 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 3\nDodge: 1\nSkill: 0\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 20\nWeapons:\nSub-Machine Gun: Damage 1D4x10 Physical Damage\n4 High Explosive Grenades: Damage 1D6x10 Physical Damage\n\u0026nbsp;\nCriminal Element\nUnlike Guerrillas, who see themselves as freedom fighters, Criminals are only out to help themselves. These characters range from thugs on the street to organized crime families but in the end they are all more or less the same. Selfish brutes who are willing to hurt anyone to get what they want.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 35\nAptitude: 35\nPersonality: 35\nStrength: 35\nAgility: 40\nAppearance: 40\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 30\nMental Health: 50\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nHand to Hand: Rank 3\nSteal: Rank 2\nHacking: Rank 1\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 2\nDodge: 3\nSkill: 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 15\nWeapons:\nPistol: Damage 3D6 Physical Damage\nKnife: Damage 1D6 Physical Damage\n\u0026nbsp;\nDissident Citizen\nWhile the Conglomerate would have everyone believe that the Dissidents are a bunch of criminals that should be shot on sight, the truth is that most of them are just regular people that for one reason or another do not live in Conglomerate facilities. The average Dissident is only different from a Conglomerate citizen in that they are much more accustomed to getting things done and taking care of themselves. Most Dissident Citizens are familiar with basic weapons and how to operate them, but it is still rare that they are required to take up arms against anyone.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 35\nAptitude: 35\nPersonality: 30\nStrength: 35\nAgility: 35\nAppearance: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 25\nMental Health: 40\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nRadio: Rank 3\nPilot: Rank 2\nHand to Hand: Rank 1\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 0\nDodge: 1\nSkill: 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 10\nWeapons:\nKnife: Damage 1D6 Physical Damage\n\u0026nbsp;\nTechnician\nWhether a Conglomerate Citizen or a Dissident Citizen, a technician is always in demand. These individuals are able to work on just about anything from a computer to an ion drive and make it go. They are passable hackers, adept mechanics and electricians and able to repair or cobble together almost any kind of machine or computer.\n\u0026nbsp;\nIntelligence: 45\nAptitude: 45\nPersonality: 25\nStrength: 25\nAgility: 25\nAppearance: 30\n\u0026nbsp;\nPhysical Health: 20\nMental Health: 50\n\u0026nbsp;\nSkills:\nHacking: Rank 3\nRadio: Rank 2\nHand to Hand: Rank 1\n\u0026nbsp;\nBonuses:\nStrike: 0\nDodge: 1\nSkill: 2\n\u0026nbsp;\nArmor: 5\nWeapons:\nNone\n\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\n  Setting:    Starting Location:    Introduction:    Complication:    Twist:    Notes:     \u0026nbsp;\n\u0026nbsp;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;\u0026mdash;-\n\n"

	"description": "",
	"content": "The one thing she had learned about her nascent powers was that she had to have a very clear objective in mind when she tried to invoke them. In thinking about it, she supposed that was why, at first, she had to teleport to Kalijor initially, then back to the \u0026lsquo;real\u0026rsquo; world in order to move between two points. While she still had no idea of how these abilities worked or where they were coming from, now she merely had to have a clear picture in her head of where she wanted to be.\nWhich raised the question of how Anja had figured them out so quickly. If Riana\u0026rsquo;s epiphany was correct, then it meant the abilities were at least partly related to her physical being. Something about her construction, or composition, that could be inherited by another when\u0026hellip; She shuddered, remembering Vincent\u0026rsquo;s recounting of the altercation he\u0026rsquo;d had with the half-Anja, half-Shantal creature in Ceres.\nPulling her thoughts back to the moment, she focused on her destination. She concentrated on a corner of the room, some place out of the way, where she could pop in and be in less danger of startling someone, or better yet, being seen at all. Making sure her weapons were all properly concealed, she opened her eyes and pushed with her mind, aiming for that dark corner on the balcony. She felt space bend around her, warping and pressing in on her in mild protest to her passing. A brief flash of utter darkness washed over her, gone just as quickly as it had come, and a heartbeat later she was there, in the corner she had pictured.\nThe driving beat of the music from below slammed into her chest, staggering her breathing even through the audio dampening field that kept the majority of the sound on the first floor. The lights were dim, providing the dozen or so sunken computer terminals and their occupants with their ideal mood lighting. As she moved from the shadowed corner into the balcony proper, she could see that the terminals were all occupied with people, mostly young kids, hard at work with whatever nefarious jobs they\u0026rsquo;d been given by The Ether-Bean\u0026rsquo;s proprietor, Almon Genloe.\nThe man had his fingers in literally every business in the city, whether it was legitimate or illicit. Genloe knew everything that happened in the city, and most of the solar system, and he knew just about everyone there was to know. Of course, he did nothing for free and was a ruthless adversary to have. The last time Riana had been there, she, Vincent, and Daray had shot up the place and made a rather hasty retreat. She knew he was a lot of things, but forgiving was not one of them.\nShe made it less than halfway down the sweeping, curved staircase to the main floor before she found herself blocked by a pair of hulking cyborgs that had been shoehorned into classic gangster suits. Her head was still above the invisible sound barrier separating the two floors of The Ether-Bean, so she couldn\u0026rsquo;t hear anything the leader of the pair was saying to her, but the way they stood shoulder to shoulder, blocking the entire stairway, and shaking their heads menacingly, told her everything she needed to know. Casting her gaze over the bannister rail, she saw two similar thugs looking up at her from either side of the front door, and another pair by the hallway that led to the building\u0026rsquo;s rear exit. Turning around, she smiled up at another pair of enforcers that had appeared at the top of the stairs, raising her hands to indicate that she was not intent on making a scene as she moved back up to the balcony and in-between the waiting brutes.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi there,\u0026rdquo; Riana chirped as the goons from below moved up behind her, fencing her in-between the four of them.\n\u0026ldquo;Mister Genloe will see you now,\u0026rdquo; one of them growled. She could only tell which by pinpointing the sound\u0026rsquo;s source. None of them had mouths, or lips, or any other articulated parts that might be indicative of their speaking.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t realize I had an appointment,\u0026rdquo; she rolled her eyes as they started moving toward the back of the balcony and the single, nondescript door that adorned the center of the wall. The giants flanking it with their backs to the wall and their dark photoreceptors scanning the room around them, wary for any signs of danger, held all of the ominous foreboding that the door did not.\n\u0026ldquo;Mister Genloe always makes time for his favorite guests,\u0026rdquo; one of them replied as they moved up to the larger guards.\nEyeing them up and down, she spied hints of enough on-board weapon systems to level a light cavalry unit, and judging by their size and bulk, she suspected they had the armor and strength to fend off an artillery barrage while working their magic on the infantry. She was certain the pair was sizing her up as well, although their atypically dark photoreceptors gave no real indication of their inspection. Neither did they move to let on that they were anything other than statuary, until some unseen signal apparently alerted them that everything was alright and they stepped clear of the door as it slid open with a quiet hiss.\nThe formation of cyborgs surrounding her broke to move through the doorway, two moving through ahead of her and two behind, but it reformed as soon as they were through and the door was closed behind them. Riana realized it had been a long time since someone had taken what danger she might represent a little too seriously, but this situation certainly filled in the gap.\nAs they moved into the large office, with its many glass and gun-metal appointments, her escorts turned her toward the outside wall where Almon sat behind a desk not too different from Xavier\u0026rsquo;s. It was large, transparent, and bore only a small, crystal obelisk of some kind as decoration. Straight, simple, and to the point. Almon was reclined slightly in a simple black chair with shining chrome accents and supports, elbows resting on the armrests and fingers steepled in front of his mouth as he watched the procession approach.\n\u0026ldquo;Good day, Miss Thorindal,\u0026rdquo; he began in a level tone, adding, \u0026ldquo;It is Miss Thorindal, isn\u0026rsquo;t it? Not Miss Reyals?\u0026rdquo;\nNarrowing her eyes at him, Riana shouldered her way through the assembly of guards around her, stepping toward the expanse of glass. She was stopped short by a hand on each of her shoulders, but she kept her eyes locked on Almon. \u0026ldquo;How do you know that name?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;That is the name your doppelg\u0026auml;nger is using. I understand it is part of your hidden past, although the details to that are, sadly, still unknown to me. I don\u0026rsquo;t suppose you would be willing to enlighten me?\u0026rdquo; He arched his eyebrows in question.\n\u0026ldquo;Not likely, Genloe. Get your thugs off of me before I start hurting them,\u0026rdquo; she grunted, rolling a shoulder to try and dislodge one of the cyborg\u0026rsquo;s hands.\nAlmon went silent for a moment, eyeing the scene before him, then nodded almost imperceptibly to her escorts. Without a sound, they released her shoulders and retreated to the back and sides of the room, standing up against the walls where they had a clear and overlapping field of fire on her, but were out of the way. \u0026ldquo;I thought not. But if I\u0026rsquo;ve learned one thing in my time, Riana, it is that if one does not ask, then one is unlikely to receive. So, please, have a seat. What can I do for you?\u0026rdquo; He motioned to one of the chairs opposite his desk.\nEyeing him for a moment, Riana picked up one of the chairs and inspected it briefly before placing it in a new spot and sinking into it. \u0026ldquo;I was just leaving when your thugs accosted me. I don\u0026rsquo;t want anything from you, Genloe.\u0026rdquo; Her ears laid back in annoyance as she spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;An interesting thing, in and of itself,\u0026rdquo; he responded. \u0026ldquo;Normally, people don\u0026rsquo;t come here without something in mind. Some reason to be here. Yet here you are, just leaving. You have\u0026nbsp; no reason in mind for being here, and no one saw you enter. I must admit, you have piqued my curiosity.\u0026rdquo;\nRolling her eyes, she fixed a hard stare on him and shook her head ever so slightly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m just passing through. If I could have gone a different way, believe me, I would have done.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which implies some significance in this location, if nothing else,\u0026rdquo; he said, watching her.\n\u0026ldquo;I doubt you would believe me, even if I could properly explain it,\u0026rdquo; she sighed. \u0026ldquo;So, can I get out of here, or are you going to make me burn the place down?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I hardly think we need to go to such extremes,\u0026rdquo; he smiled, leaning back in his chair and motioning toward the door. \u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s the door. By all means, feel free to use it.\u0026rdquo;\nEyes flitting to the door, Riana considered taking him up on his offer. After only a few seconds, she dismissed that line of thought. She had to know what he knew about Anja. The fact that she didn\u0026rsquo;t know of any other places in Neo-Tokyo she was familiar enough with to teleport to was another issue, if she couldn\u0026rsquo;t get what she wanted from him and get out of The Ether-Bean through a door. Of course, she could probably handle his entourage and make a break for the exit, or possibly a window. Shifting her focus to the window behind Almon for a moment, she cracked an internal smile, ears perking up as she locked her eyes back on him once more and cocked her head to the side.\n\u0026ldquo;Okay, you win.\u0026rdquo; She smiled. \u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In exchange for what?\u0026rdquo; He arched an eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything you know about Anja\u0026hellip; Reyals\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she bit the last name off like a bitter pill that she wanted nothing to do with. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t heard Anja using that name before, and the fact that she was meant that Anja knew more about Riana\u0026rsquo;s past than she was comfortable with.\n\u0026ldquo;Everything?\u0026rdquo; He prodded.\nSighing, ears cocking back with annoyance, Riana nodded. \u0026ldquo;Yes, everything. But I\u0026rsquo;m only compensating you for information that is new to me, so we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to work out some kind of sliding scale here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am afraid that information has an entirely subjective value,\u0026rdquo; he began. \u0026ldquo;Said value is only as much as someone will give you for it. Since you are asking for fairly pointed information, my assumption is that its value is higher to you than it may be to someone else. Therefore, I am disinclined to let go of said information for any sum of money. I feel you must match my information with information of reciprocal worth to me as what I offer you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;How do I know you won\u0026rsquo;t lie to me?\u0026rdquo; she asked.\n\u0026ldquo;You must trust me, as I must trust you. I am many things, Riana, but a liar is not one of them.\u0026rdquo; He smiled back at her.\n\u0026ldquo;There are things I won\u0026rsquo;t tell you,\u0026rdquo; she added. \u0026ldquo;Things that aren\u0026rsquo;t mine to tell.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I offer you the right to refuse a question, based upon those sentiments. However, if you do so, I will ask two questions in its place. Questions you must answer, unless they similarly violate your personal ethics. If you refuse two questions in a row, then our exchange is over and you leave.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And if you don\u0026rsquo;t want to answer my questions?\u0026rdquo; she prodded.\n\u0026ldquo;I will answer any and all questions not pertaining to myself, or my immediate business dealings. Everything else is fair game,\u0026rdquo; he replied.\nNarrowing her eyes, Riana gave him a long, hard look, then nodded. \u0026ldquo;Funny, I thought you\u0026rsquo;d be more upset about my last visit. You\u0026rsquo;re being a lot more reasonable than I was led to believe you are even capable of.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Business is business, Riana. You localized the damages, made an expeditious exit, and pointed out numerous flaws in my security in the process. I am willing to call it a wash, provided there is no repeat performance.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think I can agree to those terms,\u0026rdquo; she confirmed.\n\u0026ldquo;Very well, then. I will let you ask the first question,\u0026rdquo; he smiled, steepling his fingers again.\nTaking a deep breath, Riana lined up her thoughts. She needed to ask questions to which she did not already know, or could deduce, the answers herself. This information was likely to cost her more than she wanted to give up as it was, and the more Almon knew about her, the more complicated her life would get. Fixing her eyes on him, she exhaled and asked her first question. \u0026ldquo;What did Anja find on Mars, and then Venus Station, that sent her here to lock down the city?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;On Mars, she found a scientist, on Venus she found an engineer,\u0026rdquo; he responded, causing Riana to narrow her eyes at him, then he smiled and asked, \u0026ldquo;What is your primary power supply?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see how this is going to work,\u0026rdquo; she said, folding her arms across her chest. \u0026ldquo;My primary power supply is a model nX500a Sub-Space Zero Point Energy field extractor. What, specifically are the fields of study/operation for the scientist and engineer Anja found?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A planetary ecosystem and geological scientist and an engineer in the fields of harsh environment habitat design and complex load-bearing and articulated systems.\u0026rdquo; Almon responded without missing a beat. \u0026ldquo;What is your peak processing throughput?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ten point six exaflops, nominally,\u0026rdquo; she fired back. \u0026ldquo;Why did she choose Neo-Tokyo? What is it that brought her here?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Building Zero, and a lack of Conglomerate corporate headquarters. What is the maximum range of your teleportation?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana paused for a moment, taken a bit by surprise at his blatant admission that he knew she could do\u0026hellip;. whatever it was she could do. Her response earned her a barely perceptible smile from Almon as she responded. \u0026ldquo;I have no idea. The furthest I\u0026rsquo;ve gone intentionally is around ten miles, and the furthest I\u0026rsquo;ve gone instinctively is unknown. I have no idea where I actually was on the far end.\u0026rdquo;\nHoping her willingness to respond, even though the information may not be as complete as he had hoped, had earned her another shot instead of more questions from him. After all, it hadn\u0026rsquo;t been a flat refusal to answer. Eyeing him, she received a subtle nod confirming her hope, then fired off with, \u0026ldquo;Who performed the grafting operation on Shantal?\u0026rdquo;\nHis smile widened then, a mirthful glint in his eyes that said he was either impressed, or just very amused that she had figured it out. Either way, it confirmed her earlier revelation. \u0026ldquo;He did it himself. What is the ballistic rating for your armor-woven dermis?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana thought for a moment, considering the potential uses for such information. If she told him, she would essentially be telling him how large of a bullet to use if he wanted to shoot her dead. But at the same time, the information would apply to Anja as well, and Riana hadn\u0026rsquo;t done much to warrant a bullet in the head from Almon, especially according to him. On the other hand, if she didn\u0026rsquo;t tell him, all he had to do was take a few pot-shots at her with increasingly larger caliber weapons until one finally did the job. It could take days, weeks, or even years, but he would doubtless find out, eventually. Then there was the trade-off of refusing to answer the question. Two more questions. It seemed obvious that the man was collecting technical data about her and her capabilities, but the real question was, to what end? Did he want to end her? Or Anja? Or both of them? At last, she decided to play along for a little while longer, although she also saw no real reason to give him an exhaustive report on her capabilities.\n\u0026ldquo;Seven thousand pound-feet,\u0026rdquo; she responded, narrowing her eyes at him. Her skin had stopped rounds with that much energy at range, but she\u0026rsquo;d never tried it up close, or with her reactive body armor worn in addition to her skin\u0026rsquo;s natural protection. In truth, she was fairly certain that, at range, and with her body armor in good shape, she could take a hit as much as twice that and still be able to at least stagger away. \u0026ldquo;Why is Turin Glastnost protecting Anja?\u0026rdquo;\nWhile she knew that Turin was not willing to give up much information about Anja, without getting herself and Vincent in bed with him anyway, she wasn\u0026rsquo;t certain it actually constituted real protection. But she did know from experience that Anja had worked with Turin more than once in the the past year or so, as attested to by Daray and Lana\u0026rsquo;s recounting. She also knew that the man knew more about her than even he let on during their recent conversation. More frightening yet, was the fact that Turin\u0026rsquo;s goons were sporting unreleased cybernetics and cranial augmentations from Quark Industries, which implied a level of corporate involvement that frankly scared the hell out of her. So, while it was a bit of a guess on her part, Almon\u0026rsquo;s response confirmed a number of her suspicions, which was not a good thing.\n\u0026ldquo;Turin doesn\u0026rsquo;t share all of his business plans with me, I\u0026rsquo;m sorry to say. But I can tell you that he and Anja have some sort of arrangement regarding her cybernetic systems. I suspect they are trying to reverse engineer some, or all, of her technology. What are your intentions with the Anja situation?\u0026rdquo;\nNow that was straight to the point, Riana thought. \u0026ldquo;I intend to stop her,\u0026rdquo; she said.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s an incomplete answer,\u0026rdquo; he responded before she could ask another question.\nKnitting her eyebrows, she took a deep breath and added, \u0026ldquo;Very well. I intend to go in there and drag her out where we can be seen together. If I can make her admit that it\u0026rsquo;s been her causing all this trouble, I will. If not, then just being seen together may be enough to start clearing my name. Either way, I\u0026rsquo;ll turn her over to the authorities or, more likely, put her down myself since she isn\u0026rsquo;t likely to go quietly. What kind of resistance can I expect, going in there after her?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;We know for certain that she has several dozen accomplished mercs in her employ, possibly as many as one-hundred. The majority of them are in building zero with her. Additionally, she has rallied most of the street gangs and local thugs to her cause and has directed them to hold the barricades and keep people in their homes. Most of them are only too happy to be her enforcers, especially because she has given them free reign to maim and kill.\u0026rdquo; Almon\u0026rsquo;s information was about what she\u0026rsquo;d expected to hear, but it was still nice to have a better idea of the number and quality of enemies she would face, entering the building. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ll have to kill her,\u0026rdquo; he added.\n\u0026ldquo;That wasn\u0026rsquo;t a question.\u0026rdquo; Riana raised an eyebrow at him.\n\u0026ldquo;No, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t. I think our little game has moved beyond that now,\u0026rdquo; he said, lacing his fingers together and resting his elbows on the arms of his chair.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the new game then?\u0026rdquo; She gave him a suspicious glare.\n\u0026ldquo;No game. I want you to go and root her out of there. I don\u0026rsquo;t know what it is she is after, but I do know that it\u0026rsquo;s only a matter of time before the Conglomerate decides it isn\u0026rsquo;t going to put up with this situation and vents the entire city into space. They\u0026rsquo;d rather loose everyone in here than take too many more punches to the face on this matter.\u0026rdquo; His response was troubled, maybe the first time Riana had ever seen such a thing. It was as if a caring person was suddenly sitting across from her. Then he went and ruined her rosy thought by adding, \u0026ldquo;And I won\u0026rsquo;t have them killing all of my clientele because of whatever white whale she is hunting.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough.\u0026rdquo; She nodded, leaning back in her chair as she gave him a tentative inspection. \u0026ldquo;So, I\u0026rsquo;m going to need a few things to make this happen.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Before you ask,\u0026rdquo; Almon responded, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t own anyone on either side of any of the barricades. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get Vincent in here if I wanted to, which I don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s face soured at his assumption, as close to correct as it was. Instead of jumping him, however, she changed tack and shook her head to cover the evidence of her initial response. \u0026ldquo;Actually, I want him kept out of here. The last thing I want is to get him mixed up in any of this more than he already is. The longer we can keep him out of Neo-Tokyo, the freer I am to do what needs to be done without having to worry about him. What I\u0026rsquo;m going to need will be equipment. Weapons, ammo, armor, surveillance, that lot.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Understood. Prices are high right now, due to the blockade, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure I can dig up whatever you need,\u0026rdquo; he responded.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s a shame about the prices,\u0026rdquo; she sighed dramatically. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;d help you out if I could, but with my SO accounts all frozen and it being my neck on the line across the board here, I\u0026rsquo;m thinking you can find a way to make it happen.\u0026rdquo;\nAlmon sat and stared at her in silence for a long moment before breaking into a wide grin and shaking his head as if he\u0026rsquo;d just been beat in a friendly game of darts over a pint. \u0026ldquo;Indeed it will be. Alright, Riana, give me your list and I\u0026rsquo;ll contact you with a drop point in the next twenty-four hours. If you succeed in your task, the gear is yours to keep, but you will owe me two favors. If you fail, I reserve the right to reclaim your body, or whatever remains of it, and do what I will with it.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;One favor. No wetworks,\u0026rdquo; she responded.\n\u0026ldquo;Two favors, and I agree with your no killing clause,\u0026rdquo; he countered.\n\u0026ldquo;Done.\u0026rdquo; Riana stood up and leaned over his desk, offering her hand to him. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve just transmitted the list to your system. I\u0026rsquo;ll be online for one hour beginning twenty-four hours from now. Before and after that, don\u0026rsquo;t expect to find me. If I don\u0026rsquo;t hear from you during that hour, the deal is off and I\u0026rsquo;ll handle Anja on my own.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Fair enough,\u0026rdquo; he smiled, standing up to see her past the burly cyborgs outside his office door and to the top of the staircase. \u0026ldquo;For all our sakes, I hope you meet with success.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026nbsp;\n"

	"content": "It felt strange to be almost completely unarmed. Riana wandered through one of the massive promenades in Xaman-Otoch, the North Pole section of the Earth Ring Station, as she made her way toward Vincent\u0026rsquo;s apartment. Willhelmina had decided to go back to Tranquility on the moon rather than come with Riana. She wanted to see if she could reestablish some of her childhood friendships since Xavier had been kind enough to grant them both a week\u0026rsquo;s leave from duties. Riana had offered to fly her sister to Tranquility but Willhelmina had insisted that she use public transportation so that Riana could go straight to Earth Station. She had told her to maximize her time off since she had yet to really explore the world on her own.\nShe had stopped more than twenty times now in various shops and stores along the way from the Kestrel\u0026rsquo;s hangar on the ring. It seemed that the pay for being a courier for Solidarity Online was definitely something out of the ordinary.\nShe hadn\u0026rsquo;t really been watching her account but over the course of a couple of years she had managed to accumulate millions of credits, and this was the first opportunity she had actually had to spend any of it.\nThus far, she had acquired several new outfits, numerous pairs of shoes, various accessories in the form of necklaces, bracelets, anklets, and a myriad of decorative hair clips and fasteners. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t had so much fun shopping for clothes since her last big spree in the Rathalon Bazaar years ago, and worlds away, and her only wish was that her sister could be there to help her through the selection process.\nThroughout the experience, she had to keep shifting her monowire sword around as she changed garments in order to keep the shopkeepers from noticing it. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if it was the sort of thing that would cause her trouble or not but she saw no reason to take chances with it. Her day would have been much smoother if she had left it onboard the Kestrel, but the last time she had come to Earth Station she had ended up being chased halfway around\nthis promenade by a mass of armored soldiers with automatic weapons. She was not about to be caught unarmed on the off chance that someone recognized her.\nSlowly, due to the numerous stops as opposed to any real traffic issues or obstructions, she made her way out of the promenade and into the housing area where Vincent lived. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t called him before coming to the station. Rather, she had used her connections through SO to verify that his ship, the Neophyte Serendipity, was\nstill secured in its berth and he had not left the station through any monitored points. This meant that she could be about ninety percent sure of the fact that he was here somewhere. At this point, she had but to find him.\nHer last stop had been at a small grocery store where she picked up some fresh produce and some other essentials that she intended to use to reproduce one of the more interesting meals she had eaten while aboard The Tyconderoga. She had never actually prepared the dish before, but she had tasted the flavor and researched\nthe preparation of several varieties of the dish on the net. The computer imbedded in her skull insured that she recalled every step, ingredient, and flavor perfectly and she had no doubt at all that she would be able to replicate the dish.\nMoments later she arrived at Vincent\u0026rsquo;s door, laden with the fruits of her afternoon shopping extravaganza. With no effort at all, she raised an arm-full of fully loaded bags and pressed the call button on Vincent\u0026rsquo;s door. The tone rang out clearly inside the apartment and almost immediately afterward she heard the sound of two people approaching the other side of the door.\nThe panel slid quietly into the wall and Riana\u0026rsquo;s heart leapt at the sight of Vincent standing in front of her. His long blond hair was pulled back into a lose tail at the nape of his neck and his tall, athletic body filled the doorway as he took an instant to recognize the person standing on the other side.\n\u0026ldquo;Riana!\u0026rdquo; he shouted exuberantly, throwing his arms out wide and stepping into the hallway to embrace her.\nShe wrapped her arms around him and squeezed him as tightly as she thought his body could handle, leaning into him heavily, and still managing to keep hold of all her shopping. When she placed her chin on his shoulder, she saw the other person standing behind him. She was a gorgeous, statuesque blonde woman, wearing a smart, classy outfit that revealed most of her lower legs, her arms up to the shoulders and just enough of her chest to provide a tantalizing view of her impressive cleavage. She stood there with one arm around her waist and the other holding the collar of her jacket that was tossed casually over her shoulder.\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s heart sank. In a flash, she went from being elated to feeling like a bug crushed under someone\u0026rsquo;s heel. She shrunk out of Vincent\u0026rsquo;s embrace, ears drooping down low and shoulders sagging.\n\u0026ldquo;Well I had better get going, Vin. I\u0026rsquo;ll see you next time I get leave,\u0026rdquo; the mystery woman said as she moved past Vincent, kissing him on the cheek as she slid by and then striding confidently down the hallway, calling over her shoulder, \u0026ldquo;Have fun hon.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana narrowed her eyes at the woman\u0026rsquo;s back, her ears pointing back in annoyance and briefly, she considered what might happen if she were to lob one of the fresh melons she had purchased at the back of the woman\u0026rsquo;s head. Her line of thought was interrupted by Vincent\u0026rsquo;s voice.\n\u0026ldquo;Ree? Are you alright?\u0026rdquo;Turning back toward him, her inexplicable malice toward the other woman softened a bit as she saw his concerned expression.\n\u0026ldquo;Uh.\u0026rdquo; She glanced back down the hall in time to see the other woman turn a corner and disappear from sight. Turning back toward Vincent once more, she smiled somewhat weakly. \u0026ldquo;Yeah. I\u0026rsquo;ll be okay.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent made a strange face at her, then stepped aside and, placing one hand on her shoulder, made a grandiose movement with his other, inviting her into his home. \u0026ldquo;Please, come in. It\u0026rsquo;s certainly a surprise to see you here. A very welcome surprise I might add.\u0026rdquo;\nShe made her way into his living room and set her bags down on the coffee table. Turning around to face him, her ears and shoulders drooping almost comically. Finally her emotions got the better of her. \u0026ldquo;Vin, I\u0026rsquo;ll understand if you don\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip; I mean, if you and I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nVincent looked at her quizzically for a moment before understanding finally spread across his face. \u0026ldquo;What? Her? Oh lord. Riana that was a client. She needs some cargo hauled out to Titan next week and was just here making arrangements for the pick-up and payment. You didn\u0026rsquo;t think that she and I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;No!\u0026rdquo; Riana almost shouted, suddenly feeling like she should be crawling under the couch. \u0026ldquo;That is I\u0026hellip; Well I know I stopped by unannounced and all, but I thought\u0026hellip; you know\u0026hellip; I mean I know we aren\u0026rsquo;t like, married or anything, but I did think that we had something, and when I saw her I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nVincent cut her off with a wide grin on his face, \u0026ldquo;You thought she and I were what? Hooking up? Riana I would never do that to you.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well I wouldn\u0026rsquo;t blame you, it isn\u0026rsquo;t as if I\u0026rsquo;m a regular girl.\u0026rdquo; She plopped down on the couch, which groaned loudly in protest of her deceptively heavy, cybernetic frame. Her dark purple hair cascaded around her shoulders, framing her face against the white wall behind her.\nVincent\u0026rsquo;s face clouded for a moment before turning into a warm smile. Slowly he moved to the couch and sat down next to her, taking her hand in his and squeezing it tightly. \u0026ldquo;Riana, I would never do anything to hurt you. I know we haven\u0026rsquo;t had as much time together as we would like, but I have not been with anyone else since we first met in Kalijor, and I would not,\u0026rdquo; he paused for a moment to emphasize his point, \u0026ldquo;be, with anyone else as long as we are seeing each other.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana squeezed his hand in response and smiled weakly. \u0026ldquo;Thank you. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry I just\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nVincent stopped her by shaking his head. \u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t apologize Riana. These feelings are normal. Your origins may be a bit irregular, but your reaction is as human as it could possibly be.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana leaned into him, wrapping her arms around him once more. \u0026ldquo;Thank you Vincent.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Think nothing of it. Now, to what do I owe the pleasure of this surprise visit?\u0026rdquo;\nHer mood brightened instantly as she sat up straight, beaming at him happily. \u0026ldquo;I got some time off to come and see my\u0026hellip; that is, to see Resonance. I thought I could come see you while I was here. I went shopping and found all of this great stuff, and I even bought some things to make dinner with.\u0026rdquo;\nShe was up rummaging through her bags happily, offering him brief glimpses of several different articles of clothing and other trinkets. Finally she held up a dead chicken by its legs and grinned broadly at Vincent. \u0026ldquo;That is, if you aren\u0026rsquo;t doing anything. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to intrude. I mean, I kind of do want to intrude, but not really if you have something else going on. Is there a place nearby that I can stay for the week?\u0026rdquo;\nVincent laughed as she continued rambling on and rummaging through her bags. Finally, he stood up, took the chicken from her, and made his way to the kitchen with it. Setting it gently in the sink, he turned back to her. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s okay Riana. You can stay here with me, and I am excited that you are here. You are welcome in my home any time.\u0026rdquo;\nHe made his way back to her as he spoke, wrapping his arms around her waist and pulling her athletic form up against his. Looking down into her violet eyes as he moved closer and closer to her lips, he spoke softly. \u0026ldquo;Of course, I will be a perfect gentleman. I have a spare bedroom you can use.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s eyes glinted as he drew closer to her. She felt a strange, tingling rush run through her body as his breath washed across her lips. \u0026ldquo;And who said I want to room with a gentleman?\u0026rdquo;\nBack to The Third Key of Kalijor\n"

	"content": "In a flash Vincent redirected the ship\u0026rsquo;s auto-pilot toward a friendly berth in the dregs and as the vessel came about to its new heading he jumped out of his seat and dashed toward the aft cargo hold.\nHe rested a shoulder against the door as he slipped his pistol from its holster and clicked the safety catch off. Quickly he used his personal computer to interface with the ship\u0026rsquo;s surveillance systems, angling the camera around the cargo hold once more to see if he could locate the strange figure.\n\u0026ldquo;Figures. No sign of\u0026rsquo;em.\u0026rdquo; He mumbled to himself as he switched off the display and returned his attention to the door where he tapped out a series of commands, programming the door to close and lock behind him so that only he could open it again in case he was over-powered.\nA moment later he slid through the door, weapon at the ready, and stood just inside the hold until the door slid home behind him. The hold was of decent size, but he knew it, and everything in it, like the back of his hand. The search was quick and methodical and his quarry turned up in short order.\nThe figure lay sprawled out on the floor behind the crate they had come on board in, just out of the cargo hold camera\u0026rsquo;s line of sight. They seemed to be unconscious again, calmly breathing and apparently unaware of his presence.\n\u0026ldquo;The hell am I going to do with you?\u0026rdquo; He said aloud as he slid his handgun back into its thigh holster and folded his arms across his chest in contemplation. Finally he turned around and headed for the door, deciding that it was best to just let the other person be. As he reached the door and began entering his security code a loud crashing noise issued from behind him followed immediately by the tooth-wrenching sound of metal dragging on metal.\nWheeling around, his gun instantly in hand and at the ready he scanned the cargo hold and eventually his eyes came to rest on the new crate. The palette he had set out in front of the open crate was scrunched up and in disarray and as he looked for what had happened he saw that the crate itself had been forced forward nearly two feet.\nSidestepping around the crate, he was careful to keep his distance as the figure came into view. They were still laying on the deck, seemingly unconscious but now their left hand, the feminine one, was extended out from the body, almost touching the back side of the crate where there was now a deep, fist shaped dent in the metal container. The knuckles on the extended hand had deep furrows in them that looked to be fresh wounds, but there was no blood and the base of the wound glinted silver instead of the white of bone.\nVincent looked back and forth from the crate to the figure a few times, the look of amazement on his face growing with each pass between them. \u0026ldquo;Great. I have an unconscious person with metal bones that can knock thousand pound crates around with their bare hands on my ship\u0026hellip; Dammit Lou, you REALLY owe me for this one.\u0026rdquo;\nHe turned to open the door again then had a second though. Cautiously he slipped back over to the open crate and reached inside, retrieving the boxes of Jovian brandy and hastening back to the door. He slipped back out of the hold with the smaller boxes and locked the door behind him.\n\u0026ldquo;Not that this door is going to stop someone that can do that to a pressurized cargo crate\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he mumbled as he finished typing in his security code. Finally he stashed the brandy in a cupboard and slipped back into the pilot\u0026rsquo;s seat to check on the ship\u0026rsquo;s progress.\nAs the Neophyte settled on the floor of the hangar bay, the large pressure door trundled closed outside the cockpit view screen. Vincent stood up and checked his firearm once more as atmosphere was cycled into the large hangar. Finally he stepped back into his ready room and strapped on his back holster, insuring that all of the straps and buckles were secure before he slid the large bolt caster from its cubby in the wall and checking it over.\nHe slid the large weapon home in its holster across the small of his back as he moved down to the cargo hold door and checked the security camera feeds again. Seeing that the figure was still sprawled out on the floor he keyed the door open, stepped inside and locked it closed again behind him. Quietly he made his way to the back of the hold and cycled the exterior door open, wincing at the smell of the massively recycled air of the dregs.\nStepping out into the hangar he was met by a small, portly man wearing greasy coveralls who smiled warmly and waved at him as they closed the gap between them. \u0026ldquo;Morn\u0026rsquo;in Vin! Haven\u0026rsquo;t seen ya \u0026lsquo;round these parts in a spell. How\u0026rsquo;re things your way?\u0026rdquo;\nVincent accepted the man\u0026rsquo;s extended hand and shook it, smiling back at him. \u0026ldquo;Hey Frank. Things are pretty good. How\u0026rsquo;s your world?\u0026rdquo;\nThe man took his hand back and scratched at his receding hairline for a moment as he replied. \u0026ldquo;Well, business is business, y\u0026rsquo;know. I guess I c\u0026rsquo;na complain much. Though things\u0026rsquo;re lokin\u0026rsquo; t\u0026rsquo;get a lot tougher ere what with the new fed cruisers com\u0026rsquo;n on line next month.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent frowned at the other man, nodding in agreement. \u0026ldquo;Yeah, I hear they are a lot faster and more maneuverable than the larger boats they\u0026rsquo;ve been fielding up to now. Should make things more interesting for us, for a while at least.\u0026rdquo;\nFrank grimaced a bit as he pulled something resembling dried tar out of his sparse hair. Once it was dislodged he looked at it passively for a moment flicked it aside before continuing. \u0026ldquo;Aye, though I\u0026rsquo;ear dere\u0026rsquo;s already a new ion drive upgrade that\u0026rsquo;ll outdistance\u0026rsquo;em by a good measure. Prolly cost an arm and leg though, I imagine.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent nodded, He wouldn\u0026rsquo;t tell his friend that he had had the new ion drives installed in the Neophyte nearly a month ago, there was no need to fluster the man. Although he was right, they had been extremely expensive. \u0026ldquo;Yah, probably. Look Frank, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how long I will be here, and you know I don\u0026rsquo;t trust anyone else to work on the Neophyte. Can you top off my fuel and water, and empty the base matter for me? I need to run an errand real quick.\u0026rdquo;\nFrank looked as though he was about to object until Vincent produced a large gold coin and tossed it to him. His eyes lit up and he nodded enthusiastically. \u0026ldquo;Sure t\u0026rsquo;ing Vin. I\u0026rsquo;ll take good care\u0026rsquo;o her for ya.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent nodded and then started moving toward the pressure door that led to the dregs. Suddenly he stopped and wheeled around, raising his finger in the air and speaking mid-turn. \u0026ldquo;Oh and Frank?\u0026rdquo;\nThe small man turned to look at him with a raised eyebrow.\n\u0026ldquo;There\u0026rsquo;s\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he searched for the best words to describe the person in his cargo hold. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;a\u0026hellip; person. In the main hold there. Try and stay clear of them, and if they make to leave, just stay away and let them go.\u0026rdquo;\nFrank opened his mouth to speak and Vincent could already imagine the stream of questions and comments about the situation so he raised his hand higher and made a gesture to stop his friend from speaking. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story and I have no idea how it ends yet, or how it even began, so don\u0026rsquo;t ask. Not yet.\u0026rdquo;\nThen he turned and strode out into the dregs, leaving Frank alone with his ship and the mysterious stranger in the cargo hold.\nIf the ring station surrounding the long-uninhabitable Earth was a testament to human ingenuity, then the dregs were a testament to the human ability to survive in the worst imaginable conditions. In the modern, corporate run society that humanity had become in the last 800 years there were still those that chose to live \u0026lsquo;off the grid\u0026rsquo;. Others had no choice in the matter as occasionally circumstances would drive people out of the shiny veneer that was the corporate world and into the seedy undercity as it were.\nThe Dregs was more of a loose knit community of vagabonds than an actual place. These outcasts had chosen the only place left in the Sol system that could possibly be inhabited as their homestead. The thick ring of asteroids that belted the center of the Solar System offered many resources to those willing to look hard enough. There were minerals in vast quantities that could be mined out, refined and used as construction materials for homes, industrial plants, even ships. Ice was available in massive quantities as well and could be extracted, purified for drinking and broken down into its constituent parts to provide oxygen for breathing as well as hydrogen for fueling both facilities and ships.\nOver time they even learned how to use the weak sunlight that was able to filter through all of the debris in the belt to grow their own crops and eventually made them self sufficient. But it was not an easy life by any stretch of the imagination. Vincent could not imagine anyone ever choosing this life as he moved through the various round tubes that connected the thousands of asteroids together into a ramshackle assemblage that these people called home, and the rest of humanity called the Dregs.\nHe passed numerous people, all of them looking decades older than they probably were, bent over from a lifetime of toiling away in nearly unlivable conditions just to scrape out a life here. The one thing he could say for them was that they were, most of them, living a life of choice, and as such, they were usually cordial and pleasant to interact with. They tended to take people at face value as long as they demonstrated a willingness to help out and work to achieve their goals.\nAs he made his way through the labyrinthine superstructure toward his eventual destination, he sighed a breath of remembrance. Finally he entered the more familiar areas of the network of tunnels and rocks, even spying the occasional familiar face among the people he passed in the access ways and passages. Memories of running up and down the corridors and causing people to dive out of the way as he and his brothers fought some imaginary battle or other flooded back through him as he drew closer and closer to the door that now came into view as he rounded the last corner.\nThe heavy metal door resounded clearly under the weight of his closed hand. He remembered it well, the sound of the door being struck echoing back and forth throughout their home when someone came to visit. A few moments later the sound of the latch being twisted open could be heard, followed by the groaning of the simple hinges as the door was pulled open to reveal an older woman of medium height, sandy blond hair and thin, but strong figure. They stared at one another for several long moments before she finally stepped aside and motioned for him to enter without a word.\nStepping past her and into the living room of the apartment he instantly recognized almost everything in the room. The furniture was still the same after all the years he had been gone. The woman pushed the door closed with some effort and twisted the lever that created the pressure seal between the door and the frame in case there was some sort of accident that caused decompression of the facility. Finally she turned around and looked at him again, eying him critically for another long moment.\n\u0026ldquo;You look well.\u0026rdquo; She finally said, her voice was strong but bore the temper of a hard life.\n\u0026ldquo;So do you.\u0026rdquo; Vincent replied truthfully. He was surprised how well she seemed to have held things together.\n\u0026ldquo;Can I get you something to drink?\u0026rdquo; She asked awkwardly.\n\u0026ldquo;No, thank you. So\u0026hellip; where is everyone else?\u0026rdquo; He motioned to the four doorways on the opposite side of the room from where he stood.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s just me now. After you left, everyone else seemed to follow suite pretty quickly. Val hooked up with the federal navy and just made Captain. I hear tell she is going to be given one of those new boats they are about to commission. Dan moved to Hektor and is running a hydroponics outfit there. It\u0026rsquo;s small but he is doing alright, growing mostly exotic stuff since the conglomerate can\u0026rsquo;t seem to figure out that little trick. I haven\u0026rsquo;t heard from Matt and Tanner for about five years now. Last I heard they were starting up some kind of private investigation business on Earth Station.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent watched her intently while she spoke, he knew she had been devastated when he had chosen to leave, but he didn\u0026rsquo;t know that his leaving would precipitate the demise of the entire family. \u0026ldquo;Mom I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The words stuck in his throat.\n\u0026ldquo;I knew you would come back Vincent. And I knew why you left. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t your fault when you father died, and it certainly wasn\u0026rsquo;t your fault that all your brothers and sister left after you did. I\u0026rsquo;ve been making ends meet here.\u0026rdquo; She sounded sincere but the edge stayed on her voice.\n\u0026ldquo;I know mom. I just. I didn\u0026rsquo;t know how to reconcile dad\u0026rsquo;s death. Nothing made sense to me any more after he was gone and they only just started to make sense again recently.\u0026rdquo; A vision of the strange figure laying on the deck of his cargo hold made him second guess the statement but he tried not to let on about it to his mother.\n\u0026ldquo;I know what that\u0026rsquo;s like Vincent. These things take time. I\u0026rsquo;m just glad you finally made it home again.\u0026rdquo;\nA moment later they were embracing in the center of the room and Vincent felt that long forgotten comfort that only the embrace of a mother can offer. \u0026ldquo;I missed you mom. I should have come sooner but I had convinced myself you would be long since gone by now so I kept putting it off.\u0026rdquo;\nShe broke the embrace and held him out at arms length, looking at him with a stern look. \u0026ldquo;You thought I was gone? Where would I go?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know mom. I just\u0026hellip; Well I\u0026rsquo;m just glad you are here. What have you been doing to keep this place up?\u0026rdquo;\nShe smiled at him then, a knowing, motherly smile. \u0026ldquo;I have my ways boy. Don\u0026rsquo;t you worry about me. After your father died I sold off the refining equipment and got a new start in compression gear. I always had a head for gasification and compression technology. Anyway, almost all the hydrogen and oxygen in the dregs is run through my equipment before it is used in ships or anywhere else.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent looked flabbergasted for a moment before a wide grin broke across his face. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know why I ever would have considered another scenario.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re darn right boy. Now. Tell your mother what YOU have been doing for ten years. Out there on your own.\u0026rdquo; She plopped down into a chair and crossed her legs as she looked at him expectantly.\nVincent found himself a seat on the couch, looking across the room at her and smiled. \u0026ldquo;Well, I run my own shipping business. It\u0026rsquo;s small, just the one ship, but I am doing pretty well, all things considered.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;So what\u0026rsquo;s keeping you from the big time then? You were always the best pilot in the Dregs. No reason you shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be running the shipping lanes for the whole Sol system.\u0026rdquo; She asked pointedly, raising an eyebrow at him.\nHe sighed as she looked at him. How did she always know when he was holding back? \u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; I guess the only way to say it is that I\u0026rsquo;m not particularly choosy as to what I ship.\u0026rdquo;\nShe arched her eyebrow at him again, instantly understanding. \u0026ldquo;My son, the runner, eh? How\u0026rsquo;d you get in that line?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a long story mom, and I promise I will tell you. Soon. But right now I am in the middle of something and I have to get going. I just didn\u0026rsquo;t want to miss the opportunity to see you while I was here.\u0026rdquo; He stood up and began slowly moving toward the door to let himself out.\n\u0026ldquo;Vincent, you just got here are you sure you can\u0026rsquo;t stay a while?\u0026rdquo; She was up in a flash and beat him to the door.\n\u0026ldquo;I wish I could mom but this run is pretty\u0026hellip; strange, and I need to get this\u0026hellip; box\u0026hellip; off my ship. I\u0026rsquo;ll come back straight away though, as soon as I get rid of it, and we can talk for as long as you want.\u0026rdquo;\nShe eyed him again for a long moment, then wrenched the door open once more and turned to face him. \u0026ldquo;You had better!\u0026rdquo;\nHe grinned at her. \u0026ldquo;I will mom. I promise.\u0026rdquo; He stepped through the doorway and turned around to face her once more. \u0026ldquo;Oh and one more thing before I go.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes?\u0026rdquo; She prodded.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve met someone. She\u0026rsquo;s really great mom. And\u0026hellip; I think I\u0026rsquo;m going to ask her to marry me\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "The explosion shook the lab despite its magically indestructible walls. Students gathered in the hall around the laboratory as professors dashed bravely into the thick, acrid smoke billowing out the door. It seemed like an hour before two of the Academy\u0026rsquo;s professors dragged her unconscious body out of the stinking cloud. Her robes were a tatters, blasted to shreds by the concussive force of the explosion and her face was black with soot and bore streaks of various other colors radiating out from her nose like a kaleidoscope. Her hair was thick and matted with ash and soot, its normally fine, platinum strands frozen in some parody of the explosion itself, as if it had been caught mid-way through blowing up and froze in fear of being seen.\nShe lay on the floor, unconscious and half naked as people rushed in and out of the lab, hurling protective and clarifying spells at the source of the explosion. Her long, tapered ears laying limply at the sides of her head, almost as though they had been knocked unconscious as well.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh my gods! Ree!!\u0026rdquo; Katrina shouted as she pushed through the crowd without a care for who she was stepping on or knocking over in her mad dash toward her unconscious sister.\nFor her part, Katrina\u0026rsquo;s robes were immaculate, looking almost freshly pressed despite being near the end of a long day of classes. Her own platinum locks seemed to remain in a single cascade down the center of her back despite her mad dash, and her own ears pointed back from her head in frustration and concern, flushing red as she got close enough to the elf on the floor to take in the entire picture.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh Ree! What happened?!\u0026rdquo; She knelt down next to her twin sister\u0026rsquo;s unconscious form and gently touched her neck, feeling for any sign of a pulse.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Katrina, we\u0026rsquo;re going to have to take her down to the infirmary. We\u0026rsquo;ll know more after we get a chance to clean her up and check her for injuries.\u0026rdquo; The stern voice of Professor Garn came in reply, his gnarled hand resting on Katrina\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. Katrina\u0026rsquo;s eyes welled up with tears at the sight of her unconscious sister\u0026rsquo;s charred body being levitated down the hallway by two mages as Professor Garn held her back from following the procession.\n\u0026ldquo;Let me GO! That\u0026rsquo;s my sister!\u0026rdquo; She screamed at the man holding her back. It never dawned on her that he seemed impossibly strong for his age. Humans typically only lived for a century and Professor Garn had admitted to being close to the end of his days. For him to hold back the young elf with a single hand should have been next to impossible, not that such a thing was in danger of crossing the troubled elf\u0026rsquo;s mind under the circumstances.\nGently the old man turned her around and looked into her acidic yellow-gold eyes with his own, cloudy blue orbs. \u0026ldquo;Calm yourself Katrina. She is alive. We will not know more for a little while, but the healers need time to do their work and that will be impossible with a wailing elf in their midst.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina looked up at him briefly before looking back down the hallway in time to watch the sea of students closing behind the procession. Quickly she stood up, attempting to break the man\u0026rsquo;s grasp on her upper arm and chase after her wounded sister, but again, his grip held firm, almost pulling her off her feet. After regaining her balance she wheeled around on the man, ready to blast him with a fireball despite the fact that he would likely bat it away, then ruin her, and her future at the Academy in a breath.\nAs she turned to face him, ready to throw it all away in order to be at her sister\u0026rsquo;s side, he simply smiled at her. It was a soft, understanding, even knowing smile that spoke volumes about his understanding, compassion, and desire to let her go. The next heartbeat saw Katrina calming down immensely, the fury quickly draining out of her.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s better Katrina. We\u0026rsquo;ll get you down to see her in the next few minutes. In the meantime however, I wonder if you might be interested in helping me determine what, exactly, Riana was doing in the enchantments lab without a professor.\u0026rdquo;\nA cold chill ran down Katrina\u0026rsquo;s spine as she heard the words. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t even realized what lab this was, and since she knew, as no doubt, Professor Garn did, that Riana had no enchantment classes, this would be a difficult accident to explain, even for Riana. Slowly, she nodded her head, then followed the old man into the still-smoldering lab.\nWhile the major walls in the Magic Academy had been enchanted with powerful spells that made them more or less completely indestructible, the interior spaces were anything but. This was evidenced by the fact that all of the furniture in the room had been blackened, burned and pushed out against the walls in a circular array from the epicenter of the blast radius.\nIn the center of the devastation stood a single stone work bench, its surface still littered with various implements. Small jars, magical burners, a mortar and pestle and some other odds and ends, all charred black and half melted by whatever had caused the explosion.\n\u0026ldquo;How did all of this stay on the counter when everything else in the room was moved to the periphery of the explosion?\u0026rdquo; She mumbled under her breath as she picked her way through the scattered and broken furniture.\n\u0026ldquo;A very astute observation young lady. What do you think?\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn responded in his usual paternal tone.\nKatrina glanced at him briefly before finishing her way through the scattered remains of the lab and moving up to the counter. Gently she reached out and touched the mortar and pestle with her slender index finger. A tiny spark arced to her fingertip, causing her to yelp and jump back from the counter, holding her finger in her left hand like a wounded child.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s quite alright young lady, the magic has run its course. No harm is going to befall you.\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn encouraged, nodding toward the counter. \u0026ldquo;Go on. Tell me what you can about the scene.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina stepped back up to the counter, casting another look back at the tiny man, who nodded reassuringly. Gently she touched the mortar and pestle again. It felt like the smooth stone that she knew it to be made of, having used them a thousand times in class. The device was covered in a layer of fine soot that shimmered strangely in the light of the room, as if it was filled with metallic flakes or crystals of some kind. Bringing her fingers up to her face she inspected the soot more closely. The fine material felt almost like a liquid between her fingertips, although it was definitely dry. The reflective, colored light seemed to be coming from a mixture of tiny crystals mixed in with the soot. Slowly she moved her fingers beneath her nose and gently inhaled, instantly recognizing the scent of anthracite.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s coal.\u0026rdquo; She commented out loud.\n\u0026ldquo;Coal?\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn enquired, raising a bushy eyebrow at her. \u0026ldquo;Are you sure?\u0026rdquo; His tone suggested, as she had learned from her alchemy classes with him, that he already knew the answer.\nShe looked closer, rubbing the material between her fingers again, then turning her hand sideways and watching with some amazement as the soot seemed to slide off of her hand, leaving no trace behind. Then it occurred to her that she had heard him speak about this substance in class before. What had he called it? Not anthracite, but the primary component of anthracite\u0026hellip; Then it hit her, \u0026ldquo;Carbon!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Indeed. But not just carbon.\u0026rdquo; He smiled as she worked through the puzzle in her mind.\n\u0026ldquo;No. It seems to be composed of extremely small granules that aren\u0026rsquo;t sharp or jagged like something that had been crushed or ground down. It\u0026rsquo;s slick like mercury, but dry.\u0026rdquo; She paused as she examined the soots till covering the table, leaning in closely to get a better view. \u0026ldquo;And there are some sort of tiny crystals mixed homogeneously throughout.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What do you make of it?\u0026rdquo; He asked sagely.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s almost as if this material wasn\u0026rsquo;t ground down from something larger, but built up from something smaller. As though each grain is the smallest, simplest possible structure that the materials can build.\u0026rdquo; She dragged her finger along the counter, creating a trench in the dark material that began to fill in behind her movement as the grains of the substance settled back down to the lowest point in the same way a liquid would when poured into a container. In seconds the table was covered again, as if her finger had never disrupted the surface.\n\u0026ldquo;Interesting isn\u0026rsquo;t it?\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn commented from his position over by the door.\nNext Katrina reached out to the mortar and pestle and attempted to pick the heavy stone device up, but it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge. She tried it again, working to get a solid grip on the smooth stone surface but to no avail. Finally she reached into the mortar, wrapping her fingers around the pestle, she applied a gentle pressure but found that it wouldn\u0026rsquo;t budge either, even after she tried lifting hard enough that she felt the counter should be coming up from the floor.\nGiving up finally she turned her attention to some of the glassware, only to find that it was all stuck fast as well. \u0026ldquo;What in the name of Pandoria where you doing in here Ree?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;A very good question Katrina. Do you have any idea what she might have been trying to do? Anything she has spoken about or alluded to?\u0026rdquo; His tone was now more like a questioning school official than a paternal mentor.\nKatrina had a sudden flash of guilt as she remembered their numerous expeditions into the wilds of Kalijor so that Riana could collect some rare root, or rock. She had yet to admit what any of these things were for, but she had a very specific list of things she needed and Katrina was certain they were to be used in some sort of enchantment or alchemical concoction. \u0026ldquo;I honestly have no idea Professor Garn. I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, I wish I did.\u0026rdquo;\nHe stared at her for a long moment with a serious look on his face before his paternal smile slowly returned. \u0026ldquo;Quite alright child. Quite alright. I\u0026rsquo;m sure we will get to the bottom of this before any more harm is done. Now. Shall we head down to the infirmary and see how she is doing?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina\u0026rsquo;s heart nearly skipped a beat as she almost flew of the strewn wreckage of the lab on her way back to the door. Professor Garn followed her out and the pair began to move down the hall, passing the occasional gawking student, still trying to get a look at what Riana had done this time.\nAbout halfway down the hallway, Katrina experienced another pang of guilt as it occurred to her that, whatever it was her sister had been working on for the last few months, part of it was laying in that lab, covering the counter like some kind of inky, black soot. She couldn\u0026rsquo;t help herself. Her mouth was open and words were falling out before she could even begin to understand why she was doing it.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry professor, I left my spell book in the lab, I need to run back and grab it real quickly.\u0026rdquo; She found herself muttering, barely loud enough for the man to hear.\nProfessor Garn stopped and turned to look at the young elf with a look that said he knew better than to believe that, of all people, Katrina Thorindal was the least likely to ever leave her spell book anywhere out of reach. He looked her over for several long moments before finally nodding at her and saying, \u0026ldquo;Be quick young lady, I\u0026rsquo;m sure your sister will be anxious to see you when she comes around.\u0026rdquo;\nIn a flash, Katrina was back in the lab. She nearly bowled over several younger students so focused on this strange deed was she. Once back in the lab she quickly searched for an intact vial and, snagging one from behind the professor\u0026rsquo;s desk at the front of the lab, she moved to the strangely immobile counter Riana had been doing, whatever it was she was doing, atop. Carefully, Katrina scraped, or herded more like, a good quantity of the strange substance into the vial.\nOnce the small vial was mostly full, she pressed the stopper into place and was turning to leave when movement on the table caught her eye. Turning to investigate, she saw the remainder of the substance on the counter top spreading out to fill the void she had created. It was certainly thinner now, but it seemed as though the substance was always leveling itself out across whatever surface it came to rest on. But what really concerned her was something she hadn\u0026rsquo;t realized before, something she was certain Professor Garn would be more than interested to learn and, quite frankly, scared her out of her wits. Despite the material\u0026rsquo;s predilection toward equal coverage and flowing to the lowest spot it could reach, it still wasn\u0026rsquo;t flowing off the surface of the countertop.\nShe bent down low and examined the edge of the desk more closely and was somewhat shocked to see that the material, whatever it was, had formed a crisp line parallel to the edge of the counter, a mere hair\u0026rsquo;s width away, but still not near enough that any of it might flow over. Gently she pressed her finger into the material again and drew it toward the edge of the surface. With no small measure of curiosity, and a healthy dose of fear she watched as the strange, sooty material flowed toward the edge, only to change directions as it approached the drop, flowing instead to the sides and avoiding the drop altogether.\nOnce more she repeated the test, only this time she held her open palm under the edge of the table and, this time, the material flowed over the edge like a dark, crystalline waterfall, its tiny reflective surfaces sending colored shafts of light off in a myriad of directions as it pooled in the center of her palm. She almost lost control of herself when she realized what this meant. Standing up again she poured the material from her hand back onto the table and watched as it once again shifted around slightly in order to create the most uniform covering of the surface that it could.\nRaising the vial to her eyes she inspected the captured material, its surface sending off twinkles and shimmers in the light of the lab. \u0026ldquo;What in the name of Pandoria have you been doing in here Ree?\u0026rdquo;\nThe bright colors and sterile smell of the infirmary was a stark contrast to the dusky browns and greys of the rest of the Magic Academy\u0026rsquo;s rooms. She supposed it was related to the fact that mages knew nothing about healing magic and, seeing a definite need for such a facility, especially in light of the hundreds of students they had hurling fireballs and lightning bolts around on a daily basis, they had been forced centuries ago to take on a contingent of healers as part of the staff.\nHealing magic was not entirely unlike normal mage spells, the kinds that could produce earthquakes, lightning bolts, and thousands of other effects. The basic principals were the same really, but something about turning the wild and often chaotic powers of magic inside the bodies of living people required a completely different temperance than most mages were capable of demonstrating. As a result, the schools of healing magic were almost always closed off to those who studied the more, destructive arts. So the Magic Academy, which was the primary school for mages in Kalijor, had long ago taken on a contingent of Druids, Clerics, and Shaman to handle their needs.\nThe funny bit of that was when the Druidic and Clerical orders around Kalijor had decided that the Magic Academy would be a great place for their own students and disciples to go and practice their art before heading out into the real world. They had quickly realized that such thoughts were anything but good. The level of destruction and damage capable of being produced by an ill-informed student of the arcane arts was grossly underestimated and it took several deaths before the decision was made to station some of Kalijor\u0026rsquo;s best healers there. It was one of these Clerics that filled Riana\u0026rsquo;s vision as she slowly opened her eyes.\n\u0026ldquo;Wha\u0026hellip; Where\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; She mumbled as her world spun around her with a frightening ferocity.\n\u0026ldquo;Calm down.\u0026rdquo; The Cleric said, a soft smile adorning her pale face as she rested a warm hand on Riana\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve been in an accident. We\u0026rsquo;re just working on getting you patched up now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What happened?\u0026rdquo; Riana said. The room spun violently at her words, causing her to wince as she tried to force the feeling of vertigo out of her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Shhh.\u0026rdquo; The cleric responded, pressing her finger to her lips as if \u0026lsquo;shushing\u0026rsquo; a child. All in good time. Just take a few moments to rest while we get you fixed up.\nRiana tried to put on her best look of indignation but found that it simply caused too much discomfort and finally gave up, opting instead for her best look of utter defeat and slouching down further under the covers of the infirmary bed.\nThe Cleric smiled at her, a warm, maternal smile that seemed to carry a twinge of \u0026lsquo;stupid youngling, what have you got yourself into this time\u0026rsquo; with it. Maybe it was just Riana\u0026rsquo;s imagination, or some modicum of guilt, but she preferred to think that the Cleric was admonishing her for what she had done, it made her feel somehow better about what she had done. Then it occurred to her that she had almost no idea of what she had actually done.\nShe remembered clearly the events leading up to the event. She had ground down and mixed everything perfectly. Chanting the appropriate phrases and channeling the correct levels of energy into the mixture. She had followed the directions exactly, down to the last detail. And it had taken her months of sneaking around in the restricted libraryto come up with those instructions. How many times had she nearly been discovered there by the roaming guards? How many times had she been a hair\u0026rsquo;s width from going home with a letter explaining her expulsion from the Academy to give to her poor mother? Too many for this to be the result. She had to figure out how to get back into that lab.\nA surge of strength flowed through her body as the familiar incantations of the Cleric worked their magic. This was definitely not the first time Riana had found herself in the infirmary. Although saying \u0026lsquo;found\u0026rsquo; would be a bit of a stretch. \u0026lsquo;Put\u0026rsquo; would probably be a better word to use. This wasn\u0026rsquo;t the first time she had put herself in the infirmary. True, on several occasions she had awakened in this oddly bright area of the Academy, but even on most of those occasions her waking up here had been the results of some experiment or hair-brained scheme of hers. Fortunately, Katrina had usually found herself in possession of sufficient sense to not get involved, saving herself a great deal of pain and Riana a great many feelings of guilt.\n\u0026ldquo;Feeling better are we?\u0026rdquo; The Cleric said, smiling sweetly down at her.\nRiana nodded, and was pleasantly surprised when the room decided not to punish her for the extravagant movement.\n\u0026ldquo;Good. Now, there is someone here who would like to see you, if you feel up to it?\u0026rdquo; She asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes ma\u0026rsquo;am.\u0026rdquo; Riana replied, adding another slight nod to see if the room was still in agreement. It was.\nStanding up and taking a step back, the Cleric gripped the edge of the privacy curtain that surrounded Riana\u0026rsquo;s bed and pulled it open, revealing an elf the same size as Riana, with long, flowing locks of platinum hair and yellow-gold eyes, her ears were drooping down in concern as she waited for news and the pulling back of the curtain seemed to have taken her a bit by surprise. She shrank back from the sudden noise of the metal curtain hangars sliding across the support rod near the ceiling, but she quickly took in the scene and within seconds was at her sister\u0026rsquo;s side, grasping her filthy hand tightly in her own.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh Ree! I thought you\u0026rsquo;d killed yourself!\u0026rdquo; She gushed.\nRiana smiled slightly before responding, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sure I\u0026rsquo;ll be wishing I had when the official inquiry begins.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What were you doing in there?!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s face grew serious for a moment and she shook her head ever so slightly. \u0026ldquo;Not here Kat. Not yet.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina inspected her filthy, soot-covered face, taking in the faint rainbow colors that radiated out from the center of her countenance, the colored stripes reflected the room\u0026rsquo;s bright light with a crystalline glint much like the soot she had examined in the lab. What had she been doing in there?\nFinally she nodded slightly. \u0026ldquo;But you will tell me. Right?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked at her seriously for a long moment before grinning widely, her ears perking up mischievously. \u0026ldquo;Of course I will! You\u0026rsquo;re my sister aren\u0026rsquo;t you?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina nodded solemnly, then forced a smile and reached into a wash basin near her sister\u0026rsquo;s bed and retrieved a cloth soaked with warm water. \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s get you cleaned up a bit.\u0026rdquo; She said.\n\u0026ldquo;Not just yet young Miss Thorindal.\u0026rdquo; A stern voice cut in from behind them.\nThe twins looked round to see a small contingent of Academy staff standing just outside the perimeter of the privacy curtain. There was Professor Liraee, a short felinoid woman with acidy green eyes and a mohawk of bright red-orange hair that arched over the top of her head and down her back, eventually turning into a short tail. Professor Xora, who was a middle-aged elf who had been teaching at the academy for the past four or five hundred years of her life. Professor Genloe stood behind the group, his nearly seven foot frame towering over them and his superbly tailored robes making him look like a mobile drapery with their length. Finally there was Professor Garn, looking frail and old as he leaned heavily on his gnarled staff.\n\u0026ldquo;We would like to speak with you about what happened.\u0026rdquo; The stern voice said. At this point they could see that the voice was emanating from the mouth of Professor Genloe. It was deep, resonant, and foreboding.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry, I don\u0026rsquo;t remember much.\u0026rdquo; Riana lied. Katrina could tell because of the way her left ear twitched whenever she was concealing the truth.\n\u0026ldquo;Be that as it may youngling. we must know everything you remember if we are to determine the cause of the incident.\u0026rdquo; The soft, lilting voice of Professor Xora added. She smiled at Riana, her own ears splaying out in a sort of welcoming, pleading motion.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes! Liraee needs to know what happened so Liraee can fix it!\u0026rdquo; Professor Liraee said. \u0026ldquo;Liraee\u0026rsquo;s enchanting lab is all out of order. Disheveled, damaged, destroyed, and with Liraee\u0026rsquo;s advanced classes starting tomorrow too!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Be calm Professor Liraee.\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn soothed, laying a gentile hand on the nearly-naked feline\u0026rsquo;s shoulder. She immediately stopped her subtile vibrating.\nNo one seemed to know exactly what had happened to Professor Liraee to cause her to be so strange. She always spoke about herself in the third person, calling herself by name. Of course, she referred to everyone else the same way so that wasn\u0026rsquo;t really so odd. No, what really made Professor Liraee odd was the fact that she wore hardly any clothing at all, and that she seemed so full of excess energy that she was constantly leaping around her classrooms, hanging from wall and ceiling fixtures and squatting on people\u0026rsquo;s desks. The other great mystery concerning the strange, nearly naked feline was how, with all of her strange and peculiar traits, she managed to hold on to her position at the Magic Academy. Riana suspected that only her advanced enchantments students could really say, but that class was one taken as students finished up their time at the Academy and as a result, they all moved out of the tower before they could tell anyone anything about the class.\nRiana shook her head slightly at the strange little feline woman. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry. It\u0026rsquo;s all a blank. I remember I was working on something for my enchantments class. I was following the prescribed formula and channelling power into the infusion.\u0026rdquo; She thought for a moment then shook her head again. \u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s the last thing I remember before waking up here.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure young lady? Is there nothing more to your memories?\u0026rdquo; Professor Garn asked.\nRiana looked at him, focusing on his eyes. She hoped her lie would hold up. If she told them the truth she would be instantly thrown out, or worse, they would maker her explain things to her mother.\nEzrina was a good mother and an extremely capable mage in her own right. Possibly even one of the better mages in Kalijor, if one disregarded those mages the pursued their craft above all else. Ezrina was not one of those mages. No, she was an adventurer at heart. A wandering spirit. And she was very troubled still, by the sudden loss of Riana and Katrina\u0026rsquo;s father. They never could get her to talk about him. Whenever they asked she would turn suddenly sad and then disappear for days on end. The last thing Riana wanted to do was trouble her mother with more family problems. Little things like daughters being thrown out of the Magic Academy and the like.\nIf Professor Garn saw through the lie, he didn\u0026rsquo;t let on about it. After a long moment he simply nodded gravely at her and said, \u0026ldquo;Very well child. If you think of anything, please bring it to my attention.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course Professor.\u0026rdquo; She nodded.\nAt that, the small group of instructors moved off into a corner and began conversing quietly for a few long moments. Professor Liraee bounced up and down as they spoke and at one point even perched herself on Professor Genloe\u0026rsquo;s shoulders. Finally the group broke up and all of them except for Professor Garn departed the infirmary.\nThe old man approached the bed where the twins still held one another\u0026rsquo;s hands and watched the proceedings with interest. He smiled at them with his ancient, paternal smile and then held out his wrinkled hand to Katrina. \u0026ldquo;I wonder if I might have one more moment of your time young lady?\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina stood up and took his hand. \u0026ldquo;Of course Professor Garn.\u0026rdquo; She said. as th eold mage led her around the corner and out of Riana\u0026rsquo;s sight.\nKatrina looked at him hopefully, her entire body quivering slightly with the fear that he was about to call her out on the vial she had secreted away in her robes. When he eyed her seriously for a few long moments, her fears only continued to grow and her palms began to sweat as she fidgeted beneath her robes.\nFinally he smiled at her and produced an ancient tome from beneath his robes. The book was bound in a rough, scaly hide that looked as though it could have easily come from a dragon. There were two thick, metal bands that wrapped around the book, with hinges near the bindings so the tome could still be opened, provided of course that the reader was able to unfasten the elaborate looking locking mechanisms that bridged the gap in the bands across the open end of the book. The thing was a dark, coal black in color and the metal bands were a black pig-iron that matched it perfectly. The finishing touch to the tome was some sort of feeling that katrina got, just by looking at it. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t evil. No, it was something else. It was more like raw, unharnessed power. The sort of power that could quickly turn a mage into a mad-man for just thinking they could harness it.\nShe swallowed hard as he proffered the book, holding it out for her to take. She reached out tentatively, shrinking away again before her fingertips got closer than an inch or two from the thing. She was afraid to touch it. The thing reeked of power and she wasn\u0026rsquo;t at all sure that she had the mental fortitude to keep herself from tearing it open and devouring its secrets.\n\u0026ldquo;Go ahead.\u0026rdquo; He said. \u0026ldquo;Take ir, it won\u0026rsquo;t hurt you. It is, after all, only a book.\u0026rdquo;\nShe reached out again, this time managing to touch the binding lightly. The instant she did so, the feeling of immense power instantly disappeared. She sighed in relief as she put her other hand on the tome and took it from the old man.\n\u0026ldquo;You see?\u0026rdquo; He said. \u0026ldquo;No harm done.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina inspected the book more closely now, and she could swear the thing was breathing, or pulsing some kind of enerigy as she held it. \u0026ldquo;What is this book Professor?\u0026rdquo;\nHe smiled again. \u0026ldquo;That, young lady, is a dragon\u0026rsquo;s magend.\u0026rdquo;\nHer eyes went wide at his words and she almost dropped the book. \u0026ldquo;A magend?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes my dear, and it is not where it belongs. Now in the interest of keeping things calm around here, I suggest that you have your sister return it to the restricted shelves the very moment she is able to, if not sooner.\u0026rdquo;\nShe looked up at him again, this time narrowing her eyes slightly. \u0026ldquo;Why didn\u0026rsquo;t you report this to the rest of the faculty?\u0026rdquo;\nHis smile only grew wider at her question. \u0026ldquo;That book has an enchantment upon it that only allows its power to be used by those who do not lust for it. Most of the faculty here do not understand that and\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he paused for a moment, breathing deeply and looking up as if remembering some fond moment in his life, \u0026ldquo;Let\u0026rsquo;s just say that, despite what you may have heard from upperclassmen, i was young once too.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina smiled at him and hugged the book to her chest where she swore she could feel it pulsing powerfully with magical energy that no mage in the entire Academy could likely contain. \u0026ldquo;Thank you Professor.\u0026rdquo;\nHe eyed her sternly for a moment before turning toward the door and moving slowly with his weight resting heavily on his staff after each labored step. \u0026ldquo;For what Miss Thorindal?\u0026rdquo;\nShe smiled again as she watched the door close behind him, then wheeled around and stormed back into the oval privacy curtain surrounding her sister\u0026rsquo;s bed. Yanking the curtain closed behind herself she spun around to face Riana and tossed the heavy black tome onto the foot of the bed.\n\u0026ldquo;What in the name of the royal family are you up to Ree?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I was making something\u0026hellip; personal\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana said, letting a sigh of near-resignation escape her lips.\n\u0026ldquo;You were making something personal, using a dragon\u0026rsquo;s magend that you stole from the restricted shelves of the Magic Academy\u0026rsquo;s library?!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana narrowed her violet eyes at her sister, her ears laying back flat in annoyance. \u0026ldquo;Look Kat, I told you I would tell you all about it when I was ready.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina sat on the edge of the bed and looked down at the pulsing book, it seemed to fill the room like some incredible presence, pushing her toward the door because the space wasn\u0026rsquo;t nearly large enough for it, let alone her. \u0026ldquo;Can you even read it?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana smirked, \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ve picked up a few words here and there.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And do I even want to know how you got it out of the restricted shelves?\u0026rdquo; Katrina asked.\n\u0026ldquo;Not if you want to stay healthy you don\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What does that mean?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s face turned sour, her ears drooping down low. \u0026ldquo;It means the road there is paved with all manner of things you would never want to come into contact with Kat. Believe me.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina\u0026rsquo;s face turned a bit sour as well, hearing her sister\u0026rsquo;s words. Apparently she decided to let well enough alone and changed the subject. \u0026ldquo;Alright. When you\u0026rsquo;re ready. But remember, you promised! Now, let\u0026rsquo;s get you cleaned up a bit.\u0026rdquo;\nShe retrieved the was cloth from the cooling water basin and began the difficult task of removing the rainbow-streaked soot from her sister\u0026rsquo;s skin. It took an hour, and much complaining from Riana, to clean the remnants of the blast from her face, which left her alabaster skin an angry pink color from all of the rubbing. Katrina had just retrieved a fresh basin of hot water and was going to work on Riana\u0026rsquo;s hair when the conversation started back up again.\n\u0026ldquo;Kat I\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana started, but just as quickly shut herself up again, looking timid and embarrassed. This was an unusual state for the normally boisterous and outgoing elf.\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s the matter Ree?\u0026rdquo; Katrina tried not to look too intently at her sister, recognizing the trepidation in her voice and not wanting to push her.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m thinking about leaving.\u0026rdquo; Riana said.\nKatrina stopped her ministrations abruptly and the infirmary fell silent as if in response to the statement. The silence went on for what seemed an interminably long time before Riana spoke up again.\n\u0026ldquo;Kat?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Leaving to go where?\u0026rdquo; Katrina said. Her voice was a bit hollow and very low.\nRiana frowned. \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know. I just know that most of what I want to learn, isn\u0026rsquo;t taught here. I think I want to be a Spell-Sword.\u0026rdquo;\nMore silence. Riana felt as if she had punched her sister squarely in the nose. Feelings of guilt and self-doubt boiled up inside her. The thoughts had been brewing inside her for years now and she just didn\u0026rsquo;t feel as though she could ignore them any longer. Who else would she tell first if not her twin?\nFinally she felt Katrina\u0026rsquo;s arms wrap around her in a warm embrace. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll miss you Ree.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s heart soared, and broke, with those words. \u0026ldquo;It isn\u0026rsquo;t as though we won\u0026rsquo;t see each other Kat. We both live at home still. I just\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m not happy here.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina squeezed her sister tighter and stifled back her tears with a sniff. \u0026ldquo;I know Ree. I guess I\u0026rsquo;ve known for a while now. I\u0026rsquo;ll miss seeing you in the halls, and on lunches though. This place won\u0026rsquo;t be the same without you.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana returned her sister\u0026rsquo;s hug awkwardly. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll miss you too Kat.\u0026rdquo; Then she sighed and added, \u0026ldquo;Now comes the really difficult part.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;What\u0026rsquo;s that?\u0026rdquo; Katrina sniffled again, finally releasing her sister and returning to the task of cleaning the strange soot from her hair.\n\u0026ldquo;Telling mom.\u0026rdquo; Riana groaned.\nKatrina stifled a giggle.\nThe next day Riana was released from the infirmary by the Clerics. Her hair and the skin on her hands was still a sooty mess and the second ting she did was head for the baths and spend two hours soaking her sore muscles and scrubbing her hair. Even after the laborious scouring was finished, leaving her a lovely glowing pink color over most of her body, her hair seemed to be a bit darker than it had been before, and the roots seemed to have turned a shade of royal purple that Riana couldn\u0026rsquo;t decide if it was related to her scalp having been scrubbed so thoroughly or if it was really turning purple.\nBefore that however, she had returned the dragon\u0026rsquo;s magend to the restricted library. There wasn\u0026rsquo;t much sense in getting all cleaned up before crawling through the filth and waste in the old stone culverts beneath the bathrooms that led to the magical cleansing chamber under the library. It had taken her the better part of a year to locate the \u0026lsquo;secret entrance\u0026rsquo; and then another six months of spending mornings and evenings crawling through the sewage to map the conduits out before she could finally make her bid to steal, or borrow rather, the book.\nNow however, she was in a bit of a bind. Having returned the book, she now found herself without either the product she was creating with the tome\u0026rsquo;s assistance, or the the book itself, which would be necessary in order to make a second attempt at the stuff. And now that she had returned it, she was sure that Professor Garn would be keeping a special eye on it for quite a while to come. This meant that she either had to steal it for real before leaving the Academy to seek a Master who would teach her the arts of martial combat, or that she had to delay her departure until she she could make another attempt and then leave. This last option was a bit dubious though, since she was already a little outside the normal age for those taken on by martial arts masters, despite the fact that fourteen was incredibly young by elven standards, in the human-dominated world of Kalijor, fourteen years was only two from being an adult.\nTo top off that quandary, she still had to try and figure out what she had done wrong with the enchantment the last time. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t dared go back into the lab, although she had heard through the other students that the table she had been working on, as well as everything on top of it had, for all intents and purposes, become just as indestructible as the walls of the lab. None of them could be damaged, or even moved, by any force that the faculty had leveled against them. Even the normally delicate glass beakers and vials had become as strong as the fortress walls of the Academy tower.\nShe hadn\u0026rsquo;t read about that in the dragon\u0026rsquo;s magend. No one had, as yet, mentioned any other products, or byproducts of her enchantment, although there was talk about Professor Liraee wanting to have words with her concerning the true nature of her endeavor.\nAs she sat there, soaking in the giant, bubbling cauldron of hot spring water trying to formulate a plan for the salvation of her project, a sudden splash of the hot water roused her from her thoughts with an annoyed look on her face and her right fist cocked back, ready to flatten someone\u0026rsquo;s nose for the disruption. Her mood only improved a little bit when she saw her sister\u0026rsquo;s golden eyes smiling at her from water level near by, the rest of her body concealed beneath the frothy surface of the water.\n\u0026ldquo;Hi Kat.\u0026rdquo; She said, settling herself back down in the butt-shaped depression that had been worn in the stone bench over uncounted thousands of years of use.\nKatrina continued to prowl around the tub with nothing below her flaring nostrils out o the water\u0026rsquo;s warm embrace. Her ears stuck up like the dorsal fins of two sharks on the hunt as she moved, finally stopping mere inches from where Riana sat, trying to ignore her and come up with a plan.\nKatrina blew some bubbles, hardly noticeable given the fact that the entire tub was bubbling, but she still managed to distract her sister from whatever it was she was so concerned about.\nRiana looked down at Katrina, putting on her best look of annoyance which was almost shattered by the sight of her sister floating face up in the water, scrunching up her nose and sticking her tongue out at her. It took every ounce of Riana\u0026rsquo;s willpower to not snigger, or even break out into laughter.\n\u0026ldquo;Why so serious?\u0026rdquo; Katrina said, finally shifting around and filling the butt-shaped depression immediately adjacent to Riana\u0026rsquo;s.\n\u0026ldquo;Just trying to figure out what went wrong, and how in Kalijor I am going to make another attempt at it now that I\u0026rsquo;ve returned the magend to the library.\u0026rdquo; Riana\u0026rsquo;s face turned serious again.\n\u0026ldquo;I might be able to help if I had any idea what it was you were making.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said.\nRiana looked at her again, trying to contain her frustration at constantly being asked what she was up to. She had to take it easy on her sister though, after all, she would be doing the same thing if the tables were turned. Finally she conceded a bit, \u0026ldquo;I was making a base for some ink.\u0026rdquo;\nKatrina nodded sagely, pretending to understand. \u0026ldquo;And what would this base look like when it was done properly?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana shook her head. \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m not completely sure. It was supposed to be dark, and fine. Some kind of powder I think.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Huh.\u0026rdquo; Katrina said. Looking across the room seriously for a moment she raised a hand out of the water and scratched the bottom of her chin in mock concentration. \u0026ldquo;It wouldn\u0026rsquo;t by chance look anything at all like\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She paused for effect.\n\u0026ldquo;Like what?\u0026rdquo; Riana asked, not daring to get her hopes up that she had actually succeeded. The thought of now needing to break into some faculty store room or office to retrieve her hard-won prize weighing heavily on her mind. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if it would be worse, or more difficult for that matter, to steal the magend, or the powder.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo; know\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Katrina stalled further. \u0026ldquo;This?\u0026rdquo; She finally couldn\u0026rsquo;t hold off any longer and produced the vial from beneath the water, its top tightly stoppered and sealed with a bead of wax.\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s heart skipped a beat as she gingerly took the vial from her sister\u0026rsquo;s hands. She rolled it over in her hands and held it up to the light to see the way it played across the many crystalline grains within the container. \u0026ldquo;Kat did you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She couldn\u0026rsquo;t finish the sentence she was so flabbergasted.\nKatrina simply nodded as she watched her sister examining the vile almost reverently. \u0026ldquo;It seemed a waste to let the faculty get it, especially when I noticed some of its more peculiar properties. I figured if it wasn\u0026rsquo;t what you were after, it would at least be something for your efforts.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana turned sideways and embraced her sister tightly. \u0026ldquo;Thanks Kat. I thought I\u0026rsquo;d really messed it up.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Hey. What are sisters for, if not lying to professors in order to steal evidence of malicious explosions in Academy labs for their crazy, school-quitting twins?\u0026rdquo;\nTo say there was a note of bitterness there would have been something of an understatement.\nTwo weeks later, Riana found herself back at the Academy, despite the fact that she had, just after climbing out of the bath and toweling herself off, headed to the administration offices and tendered her resignation. She had been terrified to tell their mother, but she knew she had to be honest so she had made a great dinner and sat her mother down to talk over food. She laid out all of the pros and cons (not that there were many visible pros about dropping out of the Academy in favor of pursuing an apprenticeship with a warrior), and expressed her long-withheld feelings. Ezrina had responded by standing up, hugging her tightly, and leaving the house without a word. An hour later, their mother\u0026rsquo;s familiar rapping on the bedroom door had interrupted Riana\u0026rsquo;s quiet sobbing and when she entered the room carrying a a bundle of leather wrapped around a small sword, Riana\u0026rsquo;s heart soared. Ezrina explained that she was sorry for leaving like that, but that Riana\u0026rsquo;s words had reminded her of their\u0026hellip; father (she always paused before saying that word), had been fond of using a sword and that she had seen this fine, elven implement at the bazaar just that day. She hadn\u0026rsquo;t wanted to miss the opportunity so she had left to purchase the blade and an appropriate belt before someone else got it. They had spent a few hours talking about how to find a good master, what to look for, what to expect in the way of lessons, and how proud she was of both of them for following their hearts. So for two weeks, Riana had been wandering around the small towns and villages looking for an instructor that would be willing to take her on with no luck. It probably didn\u0026rsquo;t help that she was trying to stay within relatively short traveling distance of Rathalon so that she could get home to see her mother and sister regularly, or that she still had much research to do on her special project, which led her back to the Academy on this fine spring day.\nNot only was she having trouble locating an instructor, but she was also having trouble locating a dragon. She had been asking around while looking for an instructor, which may have ld to people not wanting to speak to her now that she thought about it. Who would want to make a disciple out of the crazy little elf girl who professed to be searching for a dragon?\nSo she had returned to the Academy, merely as a guest to the public library they kept, to search the tomes there for any clues as to the current whereabouts of any dragons she might be able to get to in order to complete the suspension for her ink. Still, she was coming up with nothing. Any book that referenced the location of a dragon, quickly followed it up with how the beast had been slain by some knight errant or other.\nCurrently she had her nose buried in a fine tale about how most of the dragons had \u0026lsquo;left\u0026rsquo; the world (that was the description the author used to avoid describing the no doubt violent destruction of each and every one of the creatures). She was beginning to loose hope that she would ever find a living dragon, and where would she get a dragon\u0026rsquo;s saliva if not from a living, breathing, and presumably drooling, dragon?\n\u0026ldquo;Good book?\u0026rdquo; A woman\u0026rsquo;s voice startled Riana halfway out of her chair. The thing would have clattered to the floor and made a terrible racket had the offending woman\u0026rsquo;s quick reflexes not allowed her to snatch it.\nRiana looked around and saw the strangest sight she had seen in all of her life. Before he stood a human woman of medium height with short hair, streaked through with alternating light blue and blond stripes. She had more earrings than Riana had ever seen on a single person at one time before, and that wasn\u0026rsquo;t counting the numerous studs and rings adorning her eyebrows, nose, septum, lips, and even the bridge of her nose. Her clothing was somewhere between roguish and risqu\u0026eacute;, with alternating patches of bare skin, leather, chain mail, and metal plates. She wore at least two swords across her back, two more dangling from the numerous layers of belts around her waist and an untold number of knives seemed to have their handles poking out of her chaotic outfit ant random angles.\nThe only thing Riana could really even begin to think about the woman, aside from how much she scared her, was how long it must take her to don the overly-complicated outfit in the morning. Riana stared at her, ears splayed out in dismay, for several long moments before she realized the woman was speaking to her again.\n\u0026ldquo;What?\u0026rdquo; Riana asked.\n\u0026ldquo;I said, are you enjoying the book?\u0026rdquo; The woman repeated again, a knowing smirk spreading across her face.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip; uh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana\u0026rsquo;s thoughts ran out.\n\u0026ldquo;Here. Sit back down.\u0026rdquo; The strange, metal-studded woman said softly, standing Riana\u0026rsquo;s chair back up and motioning toward it with her other hand.\nRiana sat down dumbly, still staring at the woman, unable to conceal her amazement.\nThe woman slid easily into the chair opposite Riana\u0026rsquo;s and leaned forward, resting her chin on her hands and smiled at the elf. \u0026ldquo;You know, if you keep looking at me like that, people will think you\u0026rsquo;ve got the hots for me.\u0026rdquo; She grinned.\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s face turned scarlet and her ears sagged as she tried to disappear into the chair.\n\u0026ldquo;How old are you little elf?\u0026rdquo; She asked pointedly.\nRiana looked at her sharply, her ears moving back to the sides of her head, pointing straight back. \u0026ldquo;What would you want to know that for?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because I\u0026rsquo;m trying to figure out who I\u0026rsquo;m talking to.\u0026rdquo; The woman replied. Her demeanor remained impassive.\n\u0026ldquo;My name is Riana Thorindal, Daughter of Ezrina Thorindal from Rathalon, and I am fourteen years old!\u0026rdquo; Riana announced somewhat pridefully. Her family wasn\u0026rsquo;t important by any means, but they had a nice home and some old wealth, albeit small.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, calm down Riana Thorindal, daughter of Ezrina Thorindal of Rathalon.\u0026rdquo; The woman smiled again.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re making fun of me.\u0026rdquo; Riana pointed out.\n\u0026ldquo;Maybe a little. No harm done.\u0026rdquo; She replied.\n\u0026ldquo;Well since I have introduced myself and you seem comfortable enough to make fun of me, maybe you should tell me your name as well.\u0026rdquo; Riana prodded.\nThe woman stood up gracefully and bowed slightly, adding a flourish with her gloved hands. \u0026ldquo;I am Adonna Gromstein, Daughter of Edward Gromstein of the village of Sunil.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked at her stiffly. She\u0026rsquo;d never heard of such a place. Why would this strange woman come out of nowhere and start speaking to her?\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry,\u0026rdquo; she began, \u0026ldquo;but is there some reason you are here making fun of me in a public library?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yes.\u0026rdquo; Adonna replied.\nRiana stared at her for a few minutes, waiting for the stranger to finish. When it became obvious that she wanted her to ask, Riana finally relented. \u0026ldquo;And that would be?\u0026rdquo;\nAdonna\u0026rsquo;s smile widened and she stared for a few minutes longer before it became obvious that Riana was about to crack. \u0026ldquo;I heard you were asking for the location of dragons in Avian a few days back.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s look instantly grew serious, her interest piqued. \u0026ldquo;I was. Do you know where I can find one?\u0026rdquo;\nAdonna looked at her seriously. \u0026ldquo;I do. But I\u0026rsquo;m not sure I relish the thought of some elf youngling dragging the ground behind me as I go after it. I was expecting something a little different from someone advertising their search for dragons.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana glowered at her. \u0026ldquo;Well if you don\u0026rsquo;t like what you see, then just get moving. Since no one is interested in helping me, I have a lot of work to do on my own here.\u0026rdquo;\nAdonna\u0026rsquo;s smirk returned. Meet me outside the Academy\u0026rsquo;s doors at first light tomorrow. Pack light, nothing that you can\u0026rsquo;t fit in a single pack. Loose the robes if you intend to use that sword your wearing. You need something that you can move in. Also, bring some rations. Have you ever traveled before?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana\u0026rsquo;s head was swimming, she almost didn\u0026rsquo;t hear the question. It took her a moment but she finally shook her head no. \u0026ldquo;Nowhere that I couldn\u0026rsquo;t get back to Rathalon by bed time from.\u0026rdquo;\nAdonna merely nodded. \u0026ldquo;Alright. Being a light bed roll r sleeping mat, something that can roll up tight and hang fro your pack without restricting your movement. Food should be dried meats, crusty breads, maybe a small amount of cheese, and water. Nothing fancy. Anything you bring, you carry, no exceptions. I will not carry your things, and I will not carry you. You hear me?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana nodded dumbly.\n\u0026ldquo;Any questions?\u0026rdquo; Adonna asked.\n\u0026ldquo;How long?\u0026rdquo; Riana stammered.\n\u0026ldquo;How long? Will we be gone?\u0026rdquo; Adonna confirmed the question.\nRiana nodded again.\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s difficult to say. Could be as long as a month if we don\u0026rsquo;t get lucky, maybe even longer if things really don\u0026rsquo;t go our way. Is this a problem?\u0026rdquo; Adonna raised a studded eyebrow.\nRiana hastily shook her head. \u0026ldquo;N..no. I just\u0026hellip; i need\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;To say goodbye to your family for a while, yes I know. Otherwise I would be asking you to go get your things right now. Any other questions?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana shook her head dumbly.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright then.\u0026rdquo; Adonna said, \u0026ldquo;I will wait here tomorrow morning for ten minutes beyond sunrise. If you aren\u0026rsquo;t here by then I\u0026rsquo;ll assume you aren\u0026rsquo;t coming and leave without you.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that the metal-studded Adonna Gromstein stood up without making a noise, despite the myriad of opportunities afforded the possibility by all of her sharp, metal implements, and strode out of the library without looking back.\nThat night Riana went shopping before she returned to their home in Rathalon. There were a few things she had never needed before, like a good traveling pack and a well-made bedroll. She also bought a nice water skin and some of the provisions that Adonna had mentioned. She wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure what else she might need though and she knew that she needed to keep her load light, so she opted for a decent length of thin, elven climbing rope and a few stakes (Along with a small mallet to drive them). She finished off her list with some odds and ends, a couple of small vials with good stoppers, and a small writing kit that included ink, quills, parchment and sealing wax, just in case she found herself in a position to take notes, or write a letter. On the way out of the Rathalon bazaar she spied a comfortable pair of boots that looked like they would fit nicely and be comfortable for long walks over uneven terrain so she spent her last few coins on those before returning home for dinner and to pack her things.\nWhen she told her mother and sister what had happened they both reacted about the same way. Looks of amazement crossed their faces, then they smiled happily to see that, though she was nervous and a little bit scared, she was excited to go. Finally they transitioned to a brooding melancholy that seemed to have them all on the edge of tears all evening. Of course, Riana\u0026rsquo;s evening was slightly more pained than the rest of her family because of the lie she had told them. She had said that Adonna had volunteered to take her on as a pupil. Not once had the word dragon crossed her lips all evening.\nPacking her bags proved to be an interesting challenge as, with all of her new purchases in her pack, there was scant room for anything else at all. She made sure to pack her heavy cloak because she had no idea what kind of weather they might encounter. Then she tossed in a small knife and one set of comfortable clothing. At that point she was having trouble securing the pack, so she knew there was nothing more she could take, unless she could get it on her belt.\nOpening her wardrobe, she began rummaging through it for something rugged, yet comfortable to wear on a daily basis. She had picked out several possible candidates and was sitting on her bed going through them when her mother appeared at her door again, holding another bundle of leather, this one much larger than the last. This time the roll offered up a bodice, some vambraces, and a pair of leggings with a skirt of studded leather strips that wrapped around them. All of this was wrapped around a pair of thin, smooth, and perfectly fitting metal bracers for her forearms. This time Ezrina explained that the things had belonged to their\u0026hellip;father (again the mysterious pause, although after fourteen years it was hardly noticeable to either of the twins), and that the evening she had gone out to pick up the sword, she had also dropped these things off at the tanner and smith respectively in order to have them tailored to Riana\u0026rsquo;s body. She didn\u0026rsquo;t want her little girl heading off into the world without a few helpful items that would also serve to remind her of home.\nRiana tried the articles on and, once she looked in the mirror, was stunned to see how different she looked. Gone was the budding mage, wearing the baggy, concealing robes of their order. In her place was a new young elf, one with a world of new experiences outside the classroom waiting for her just over the horizon. She felt as though she was seeing herself for the first time, wrapping the sword belt around her waist experimentally, she knew that she was not, in fact, leaving home at all. Rather, she had just come home for the very first time in her life.\n"

	"content": "\u0026ldquo;Well, if you say I did, then I must have. But, I thought it was impossible.\u0026rdquo; Jumah said with a shining smile.\nRiana pushed a branch out of her way as she stepped over a gnarly tangle of roots and sighed. \u0026ldquo;It IS impossible. That spell slows time in the immediate area down to a fraction of its normal pace. I mean the only way someone could possibly still move is if they were somehow immune\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Which I assure you I am not.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;or\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; she tossed him a sidelong glance, then winced in pain as a protruding branch dug into the freshly dressed wound on her shoulder.\n\u0026ldquo;Or\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Jumah prompted her, after she had taken a few deep breaths to stem the pain.\n\u0026ldquo;Or\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She continued, \u0026ldquo;If the person in question could move so fast that they could get to that state under their own power.\u0026rdquo;\nJumah contemplated this comment for a moment as he bent a particularly thick branch out of the way and held it for her as she passed. \u0026ldquo;You mean the person in question would have to be able to move so fast that they could slow down time around them?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Not slow down time per se, just move so fast that it would appear to everyone else that they had simply vanished, or teleported.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wow. That sounds pretty fast. I don\u0026rsquo;t think I can move quite that quickly, personally.\u0026rdquo; His tenor voice called out from behind her as they forged on into the forest.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t see how you could. I mean there\u0026rsquo;s only one species\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Riana now held a branch back for Jumah. As he passed in front of her, she confirmed that his long golden locks had the faintest dark splotches speckled throughout.\n\u0026ldquo;Thank you m\u0026rsquo;lady.\u0026rdquo; He flashed her another grin as he ducked under the branch and moved ahead to the next obstacle. \u0026ldquo;So, what species is this that could move that fast?\u0026rdquo;\nRiana shook her head, trying to clear her thoughts. \u0026ldquo;Were-Cheetah.\u0026rdquo; She watched his face for a reaction before continuing. \u0026ldquo;But no one has seen any of their kind in decades, possibly a century or more. Most of the were-creatures were hunted to extinction after the great wars. Nobody trusted them to not spread their lycanthropy like a plague.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see.\u0026rdquo; Jumah\u0026rsquo;s voice was a bit less jovial as he held back a series of branches for her to get past. \u0026ldquo;So what do you think?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;About what?\u0026rdquo; She turned to look at him and walked sidelong into a thick branch.Her foot caught in a clump of roots and she knew she was going to break something in the fall as she keeled over. Closing her eyes and clenching her jaw in preparation for the pain, she gasped as strong arms wrapped around her, stopping her mid-fall.\nOpening her eyes tentatively and looking up she was met by Jumah\u0026rsquo;s crystal clear blue eyes and his mischievous grin. \u0026ldquo;About these supposedly plague-bearing were-beasts.\u0026rdquo;He used his free hand to delicately chase a few locks of hair out of her eyes.\nHer skin turned hot and a deep blush suffused her cheeks. Finally she managed to turn her head away from his gaze. His hand pressed against her side and she was suddenly aware of the strength behind those fingers. His fingers were rough, but gentle as he helped her stand up.\nShe turned her back to him for a moment, pretending to adjust her belt and pouches as she tried to force her body back under her control.\nJumah watched as she shuffled and adjusted, patiently waiting and leaning against the tree he had rescued her from. When she turned back to face him, he stared into her deep, violet eyes.\nForcing herself to look at his chin or his shoulder, anywhere but those pools of crystal blue that heated her skin and made her heart thump in her chest like a goblin war drum. \u0026ldquo;Well, canine lycanthropes were the ones able to transfer their condition via bites, but the feline lycanthropes could only pass their abilities to their offspring. Or so I\u0026rsquo;ve read.\u0026rdquo; She adjusted her sword awkwardly.\n\u0026ldquo;I see.\u0026rdquo; Jumah said as he stood up and pushed a series of branches aside, holding them for her.\nShe nodded a thank you as she passed him, trying not to think about his muscular body sliding past hers.\nTaking a few strides, he was again in front of her, his hand reaching out toward the next thicket of branches. As he reached out to grab the branches, he paused just as her hand snatched his wrist. Turning to look at her with raised eyebrows, he saw her staring at his chest with a blank expression and her long elven ears perked up and splayed out in concentrated effort. \u0026ldquo;You hear it too?\u0026rdquo; He whispered to her.\n\u0026ldquo;More goblins. Just there.\u0026rdquo; She whispered back in a barely audible voice and pointed through the branches he was about to move, reluctantly releasing his arm in the process.\nQuietly, they both crept forward and peeled away some of the smaller branches and leaves. Peering through them, they saw what they were up against.\nA large clearing with a dilapidated stone tower standing in the center was just beyond their hiding place. The tower looked to be about five stories high with a disintegrating tile roof, no visible windows, and a single door around which huddled a mass of goblins. The creatures mulled about nervously as though they expected to be set upon at any moment by a monster.\n\u0026ldquo;That must be our tower then.\u0026rdquo; Jumah whispered.\n\u0026ldquo;You think?\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered back with a grin on her face. \u0026ldquo;What gave it away? I mean, aside from the horde of goblins at the door?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Obviously it\u0026rsquo;s the state of the thing. I mean, look at those roof tiles. I haven\u0026rsquo;t seen craftsmanship of that qualityin years.\u0026rdquo; He grinned back at her.\nWith some effort Riana stifled a laugh. Forcing herself back to the matter at hand, she took stock of the situation. It was getting late in the day, with darkness due any moment. There were twenty goblins guarding the single door to the tower, and they stood in the center of a clearing that would guarantee anyone approaching the tower would be seen, unless\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;How much do you like me?\u0026rdquo; She hissed at Jumah who responded by sitting up so quickly that he hit his head on a branch and then was slapped in the face by the twigs he had let go of in surprise at the bluntness of the question.\n\u0026ldquo;M\u0026rsquo;lady I\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;m sure you\u0026hellip; ah\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe turned and looked at him with an amused smile on her face. \u0026lsquo;At least it\u0026rsquo;s not just me.\u0026rsquo;\nShe leaned in close to him and brought up her left forearm, pointing to a glyph there she explained, \u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t know an invisibility enchantment strong enough for multiple people yet. But the one I do know will affect myself and whatever is in my very immediate vicinity.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ah. How immediate are we talking about here?\u0026rdquo;\nShe grinned at him. For the first time since she had met him that morning she realized that this man was not imperturbable. \u0026ldquo;Physical contact close.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t mean just holding hands, right?\u0026rdquo; His eyes darted from left to right as though he was half expecting her parents to break in on them.\nShe took the opportunity to play with him a bit, taking advantage of his apparent gentlemanly nature. Offering him a wry smile that he instantly took to daydreaming about. \u0026ldquo;I think we may have to get rather more\u0026hellip; intimate, than that.\u0026rdquo; She pressed on, relishing the rosy color of his cheeks. \u0026ldquo;Unless you want to fight the lot of them?\u0026rdquo; She jerked her thumb over her shoulder toward the clearing and the goblins therein by way of explanation.\n\u0026ldquo;Not especially, no.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Nor do I.\u0026rdquo; She stated flatly. \u0026ldquo;So.\u0026rdquo;\nHe looked around for a moment.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok then. How about this? You invis yourself and head over there with the key. You open the door and I\u0026rsquo;ll meet you inside. Just hold it open for a second before you close it.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana looked at him with a look of amusement on her face. \u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re going to run from here to there in a second? And without alarming the goblins?\u0026rdquo; She raised her eyebrows skeptically at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes. I am going to run that distance in a second, and no I won\u0026rsquo;t alert the goblins. You\u0026rsquo;ll already have done that.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;ll already have done that\u0026hellip; Why exactly?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Do you think they won\u0026rsquo;t see the door opening by itself?\u0026rdquo; He smirked at her.\n\u0026ldquo;Oh. I hadn\u0026rsquo;t thought of that.\u0026rdquo; She chided herself inwardly.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t worry about it. This way, my movement will distract them from the door and we\u0026rsquo;ll have a better chance of locking it behind us without a bunch of them spilling in first.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Are you sure about this? If we do it my way it ensures we\u0026rsquo;ll both get there at once.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because,\u0026rdquo;he paused, \u0026ldquo;we\u0026rsquo;ll have to disentangle from one another before we can deal with the goblins. I think this will work better.\u0026rdquo;\nSuddenly the sky darkened. In a matter of seconds it transitioned from daylight to night, much like somebody turning down a dimmer switch on an electric light.\nJumah pointed toward the clearing and said, \u0026ldquo;Go now. While their eyes are adjusting to the darkness.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, but I want it noted that I think this is a bad idea.\u0026rdquo; Riana whispered as her eyes glowed and then vanished from sight along with the rest of her.\nA moment later, she pushed her way slowly through the foliage with a soft rustling sound and then quietly padded toward the ominous door at the base of the tower.\nHolding the handle of Elkorine, to keep it from swinging on her belt and touching a goblin, or making some unexpected noise. Riana picked her way through the goblin guard detail, clenching Elkorine tightly in case something unexpected happened and she needed to defend herself.Moving as quickly as she dared, more than once she ended up face to face with one of the little green creatures. Eventually she reached the tower and squeezed herself behind a particularly burly looking, armor clad, goblin warrior, bearing a large\u0026mdash;for him\u0026mdash;axe. She gently slotted the old skeleton key into the door\u0026rsquo;s lock and slid it home.\nThe key bottomed out in the lock and clanked against the back plate ever so slightly. Riana held her breath as the goblin perked its ears up and began to look around. After a moment it settled down again and Riana slowly let out her breath and drew in another deep draught of fresh air. Glancing briefly over her shoulder to where she knew Jumah should be watching from, she nodded in his direction, forgetting that she was invisible. Looking back to the door, she placed a hand on its rough surface and paused for an instant to prepare.\n\u0026lsquo;Here we go. This is where we both get shot up by goblin archers.\u0026rsquo; With all the courage and speed she could muster, she twisted the key in the lock cringing when it echoed with a loud clanking noise. Wrenching the key back out of the lock, she pushed. The door swung in on its hinges and groaned so loud that she thought it must have alerted the Obscuri in their caves halfway across Kalijor.\nShe felt the activity before she heard it. The goblins realizing that someone was opening the door behind them. The slow and painful process that went in to that epiphany was almost comical, while their reaction was anything but. A sudden tidal wave of noise came up behind her as the goblins began yelling and screaming, raising their weapons in anger and foul intent.\nRiana was already pushing the door aside with her body, pivoting around its open edge and bracing her shoulder against the inside of the wooden barrier, preparing to push it closed again. The goblins\u0026rsquo; confusion focused on the open space and the empty doorway. Several crooked arrows embedded themselves in the door near her head and she looked up to see the armor-clad axe-wielding goblin swinging his weapon in a wide arc in a blind attempt at the blood of the intruder.\nShe smiled at the goblin as an arc of lightning issued forth from her right hand, dispelling her invisibility enchantment. Before they could do much more than register her sudden appearance, the blast of electricity arced back and forth through the assembled mass of goblins, scaring some, stunning others, and outright killing a few.\n\u0026lsquo;He\u0026rsquo;s had his second and I need to get through this, with or without him.\u0026rsquo; She thought as she pushed with her legs, driving the wooden door closed with all her strength. The heavy door closed against the stone with a resounding thud. Jamming the rusty key into the lock on the inside, she twisted it home with a reassuring clank.\n\u0026ldquo;Well that was fun!\u0026rdquo;\nRiana jumped at the sound, whirling around to put her back to the door and her hand on her sword. \u0026ldquo;What the?!\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Calm down m\u0026rsquo;lady. It\u0026rsquo;s just me.\u0026rdquo; Jumah smiled reassuringly at her in the wan light of the tower\u0026rsquo;s interior.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you\u0026hellip; I mean, I just\u0026hellip; And you weren\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHis smile turned to a knowing, mischievous grin. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s a trade secret. I could tell you but\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But what? You\u0026rsquo;d have to kill me?\u0026rdquo; She looked at him sarcastically.\n\u0026ldquo;No. I just think it\u0026rsquo;s more fun to make you keep guessing.\u0026rdquo;\nRiana stared at the blonde man with a look somewhere between amazement and incredulity. She had no idea why she liked him. He was arrogant and over-confident. He behaved like a child playing a game, and yet he was still somehow serious enough to make it seem as though he was here for all the right reasons. He smiled at her impishly as she stared at him.\n\u0026ldquo;Look\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; She said, releasing her grip on her sword\u0026rsquo;s handle and moving to examine the small, dark, stone room they found themselves in.\n\u0026ldquo;Is this where you tell me you don\u0026rsquo;t like handsome, capable, eligible bachelors?\u0026rdquo; His grin widened. \u0026ldquo;Would it change things if I told you I cook too?\u0026rdquo;\nShe turned her violet eyes back toward him and gave him a look that instantly withered his mood. His back straightened and his muscles tensed. He was ready for instant action and the levity was gone.\n\u0026ldquo;I am looking for my sister. She was beaten nearly to death and then dragged away by a man named Malice. I don\u0026rsquo;t know where he has taken her, but I have been able to find out that it is a place where GM\u0026rsquo;s cannot see, or go.\u0026rdquo;\nJumah nodded solemnly, taking this new information in stride, he did not appear in any way surprised by what she had said. \u0026ldquo;How long has she been stuck in the system?\u0026rdquo;\nBack to The Second Key of Kalijor\n"

	"content": "They were both up before the daylight began, making preparations for their journey. Riana had gone out and visited the clothing shop where they had found the leather garments the previous day, waking the poor man well before he was used to getting up. When she told him she was related to Ezrina, whom he had known for a long time he had readily agreed to help her by discounting the articles slightly and further enchanting the materials to reduce the friction they would cause against her skin. He also cast a few enchantments upon a belt and pouches that she picked out that allowed them to reduce the weight of anything the belt supported.\nReturning home just after light she began packing as lightly as she could, she stuffed a few of her new silk garments into a large pouch on her right hip. On top of those she put some carefully wrapped rations, and a medium sized water skin. Some other odds and ends went in as well, a compass, a set of utensils, some scraps of parchment, a small vial of ink and a couple of quills, and one-hundred feet of fine, magically-strengthened elven climbing cord; just in case they had to face a climb of some kind. On her other hip she sheathed her short sword and her dagger. Finally she rolled up her thin sleeping pad and blanket and set the roll across her back, securing it with a braided leather rope over her shoulder.\nWhen she exited her chamber, she found Katrina ready and waiting in the main room of their apartment. She was similarly packed, although most of her things were in a back pack slung over her shoulder, and she wore her normal, conservative, mage robes. She smiled at Riana when she saw her, and gave an appreciative whistle, to which Riana blushed profusely.\nRiana wore a tight fitting bodice above a breechcloth that hung to well below her knees in front and back and was settled over another leather garment that covered her private parts, but not much else. She had on a pair of sturdy but comfortable leather boots that came up to the middle of her calves, and a leather bracer on each forearm that covered from her wrists to her elbows. The coup de gras was a thick leather choker around her neck and the heavy belt that supported her short sword and dagger in new scabbards, as well as a couple pouches for coin and other odds and ends. All of the items were rich, black leather, soft and supple, with a royal purple beading and stitching that complimented her hair. To complete the ensemble she pulled on one of the more expensive items they had purchased. The fine black material of the elven cape rested nearly weightless on her shoulders, its rich purple interior wrapped around her comfortingly as she fixed the intricately detailed dragon\u0026rsquo;s head clasp at her neck and let it rest against her leather choker.\n\u0026ldquo;So,\u0026rdquo; Riana said, trying to take the focus off of her exposed body. \u0026ldquo;We take the portal to Pandoria, and then speak with the Druids.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Right.\u0026rdquo; Katrina agreed crisply.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright then. Do we have everything we need for a few days? I am sure we can resupply in Cohai before we set out for the Plain of Sorrow.\u0026rdquo; She was trying not to sound scared as hell despite the fact that neither of them had ever been far from home for any length of time. While they had both been to Pandoria before, they were seeing life through new eyes now, and even their apartment seemed to have taken on a different feeling for them. As she headed for the door Riana looked around their home, her eyes landing on a painting by the dining table, the myriad of figures within its rich golden frame bent to the task of what she had always thought to be the construction of some great monument or structure. Now as she looked at it, she saw new details in the image, the forlorn faces of the workers, the stress lines on their faces, they were bent to no task of joy. Deeper in the background she saw the rows of stone markers for the first time. The figures were erecting a tomb, a grave site for some hero that had fallen.\nAs she reached for the door, Riana was taken with the sick feeling that she would never see this place again. It was not a feeling of doom, or some disaster, in fact she was quite confident in their success. Something was nagging at the back of her aching mind as if trying to tell her to let it all go. Pushing the door open, she dismissed it as being related to her headache and stepped out into the hallway. Together, Riana and Katrina took their first steps into their new lives. Riana wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure if they were truly ready, but she knew they had no choice now in the finding out.\nBack to The First Key of Kalijor\n"

	"content": "This web site was born of two very different needs. The first was to get the information about the book, sales, author and so forth out to you the people. Thus the primary page and associated links (this page included). The second need was to get out as much information about Kalijor as I possibly can. Kalijor is HUGE. MUCH larger than my novels will likely ever be able to encompass. As such I wanted you all to have as much information as you wanted about that huge world, things that aren\u0026rsquo;t seen in the books (yet), and may never be. If you want to know the politics of Rathalon, that information is here for you. If you have no desire to know these things, don\u0026rsquo;t feel bad, not everyone does.\nJust to be clear here. My intention for the world of Kalijor is not to dominate it. Not to control it and dictate what happens within it. My intention here is to lay bare all of the gritty details of the world and its inner workings so that you all have all of the information you need to understand how things happen in Kalijor. Once you have that understanding (even if it is just abasic understanding) then it is my fervent hope that you run with it. Tell your own stories. Play your own games. Dream your own dreams! I will likely never stop writing about Kalijor. And while I fervently hope that you all will continue reading my stories, I also hope that you will be in some way inspired to go out and create your own, whether in my world or your own!\nSo come along! Enter my world! Stay as long as you like. Contribute if you see fit to do so. Or just sit back and watch!\n"

	"content": "-3- Each tangler grenade landed on the top of its target vehicle at the same time, bursting into a net of reinforced strapping and super-adhesive sprawling out over the roof and sides of the vehicle, sealing the doors closed and locking the passengers inside. The EMP grenade landed between them, exploding into a shower of blue-white sparks and fingers of lightning that played over the surfaces of the vehicles, dazzling the eye and burning up their electrical systems. Their motors died and they dropped to the ground with a heavy thud that covered the sound of Darren landing atop the small van.\nIn a second, he had his cutter out and was laying down a line of binary gel in a large circle on the roof of the van. Once complete, he set the dispenser next to it, making sure the probes touched the circle of gel, and pressed the initiate button. The gel began to glow bright orange and in a heartbeat it burned away the metal beneath it. With a clatter, the circular piece of the roof fell into the vehicle.\nCounting on surprise and quick timing, Darren dropped through the hole into the van expecting to grab the canister, or its case, and get out again before anyone realized what was going on. In all, it had only been a couple seconds since he\u0026rsquo;d attacked the convoy so there was little likelihood of them catching on just yet.\nHis feet had barely touched the floor of the van\u0026rsquo;s interior when the fist impacted his face and sent him sprawling to the back of the vehicle. He slammed into the closed rear doors, springing them from the inside to let light from the street lamps outside seep in through the cracks. His tangler grenade did its job though, keeping the doors closed despite the fact they should have been knocked off their hinges.\n\u0026ldquo;You picked the wrong vehicle to rob, little girl,\u0026rdquo; a menacing, digitized voice called out.\nDarren looked up, wiping blood from his face with the back of his sleeve. Approaching him from the front of the van, stooped over in almost comical fashion, was a fairly large cyborg, clad in combat armor and bristling with the kinds of weapons that were only legal on an unpressurized battlefield. It figured. Cybernetic systems were well shielded from EMPs, especially the military hardware. Apparently most cyborgs had some sort of issue with their bodies being shut off by external forces, so every effort had been made to insure that could not happen, even under the most direct, targeted attacks on their systems.\nTrying to shake off the jarring impact and decide if he was just going to give in and throw up right there, Darren worked to get his feet back under him. He needed options, and nothing he brought with him was sufficient to handle a military cyborg.\n\u0026ldquo;Do I look like a girl to you? Man, that\u0026rsquo;s enough to really bruise a guy\u0026rsquo;s ego.\u0026rdquo; he quipped, tipping himself forward into a somersault as the cyborg took another swing at him. The punch missed him by a hair, denting the back door in the shape of a metal fist and further pushing the door off its hinges. The material of the tangler grenade\u0026rsquo;s strapping groaned against the harsh treatment and Darren had a flash of inspiration at the sound. \u0026ldquo;Either way, I\u0026rsquo;m not sure you\u0026rsquo;re much of a match for me, so I think I\u0026rsquo;ll just grab what I came here for and be on my way.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I think you know that isn\u0026rsquo;t going to happen,\u0026rdquo; the cyborg replied as he extracted his fist from the door and swiveled around to see Darren at the other end of the space, up against the metal wall that separated the cargo area from the cabin.\n\u0026ldquo;I think you\u0026rsquo;ll find that I am full of surprises.\u0026rdquo; Darren grinned, then winced as his swelling cheek protested the action. Scanning the space, he caught sight of numerous small cases and boxes, but only one of them was large enough to contain the canister he\u0026rsquo;d been sent to retrieve, so he began wrapping his plan around the location of the case, eyes roaming the interior of the van for anything he could use to his advantage. At last, he decided on a course of action, just as the cyborg reached for him again.\nMoving as fast as he could, Darren ducked under the cyborg\u0026rsquo;s arms, launching himself into his opponent\u0026rsquo;s legs, wrapping his own arms around the other man\u0026rsquo;s shins, pushing against the dividing wall with all the strength that his genetically-enhanced legs could muster. Under normal circumstances his tactic would stand little chance of success, but in the tight confines of the van, with the cyborg bent over and squatting, the environment was in his favor, to some extent.\nHe felt the other man topple forward, but the motion didn\u0026rsquo;t go the way he hoped. A second later he felt himself being dragged backwards with his opponent, falling down on the other man\u0026rsquo;s chest as he clattered to the floor with a loud crash. The cyborg\u0026rsquo;s hand closed on Darren\u0026rsquo;s jacket, one of its fingers slipping through the bullet hole that had been put there earlier and allowing the man to find a purchase that he might not otherwise have had.\nStruggling to get himself off the cyborg, Darren slipped one arm out of his jacket and grabbed hold of the nearest object he could find. Bashing the man in the face with it, he filled the van with metal-on-metal clangs as he struggled to get free. In much tighter quarters that prevented him from using his parkour and capoeira skills, it was beginning to show in the form of a mild panic. He needed out of there. He was not equipped to scrape with cyborgs. He was a thief, not a brawler. While he could handle himself in a fight, he\u0026rsquo;d long ago learned that it meant less to know how to fight than it did to know when to fight. And this was not the latter.\nIt took him a moment to realize that the cyborg had stopped moving. He had no idea how long he\u0026rsquo;d been hammering away at it with the metal case, but looking down at it he saw the man lying there, arms and legs twitching like a toy with a malfunctioning remote control. His metallic skull was dented and smashed in several places and one of his dark, glossy black photoreceptors was cracked and crushed in.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit,\u0026rdquo; Darren cursed, looking down at the case in his hands. It was familiar somehow, but the crushed in corners and edges and the sprung latch made it difficult to identify. Prying it open despite the mangled hinges, he looked inside to see the familiar shape of the canister he had been sent to retrieve. It was nestled in a bed of form-fitting, shock-absorbent material and a small trickle of some kind of bright neon orange goop was sliding down the length of the cylinder from one end.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit,\u0026rdquo; he repeated.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;ve got that right, kid,\u0026rdquo; the familiar voice of the cyborg announced. Darren looked over the top of the case to see that the smashed and mangled head of the cyborg was back up off the floor, as was one of its arms. In that arm was, what looked from Darren\u0026rsquo;s perspective to be, a howitzer, pointed right at his chest. \u0026ldquo;I told you this was a bad idea. Now you get to be an example to everyone else of what happens when you mess with Solidarity Online.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Wai\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Darren began to say, but the electric sizzle of the cyborg\u0026rsquo;s energy weapon spooling up power cut him off. All he could do was try and shield himself somehow, so he raised the case in his arms, positioning it between the weapon and himself even as the red-orange lance of super-excited death leaped out at him.\n"

	"content": "As he made his way around the last corner, leading to the hanger where the Neophyte Serendipity was berthed, he knew he was in for a long day. The sound of the emergency alarm rang out from his hangar and the pressure door appeared to be bent into the hallway, having been forced open from the inside. Silently he cursed to himself as he drew his pistol and dashed down the hallway, sliding up to the door with his back to the wall.\nThe thick, alloy pressure door was bent up so badly that it would probably be good for nothing but recycling and he spied what distinctly looked like knuckle prints in several places on the distended surface of the abused door.\nWith practiced efficiency he spun around as he stepped quickly across to the other side of the doorway, allowing himself to get a quick glimpse of what was going on inside the hangar. Seeing no immediate threat he slipped through the door, weapon at the ready. Frank lay sprawled on the floor outside the open door to the Neophyte. He was face down and didn\u0026rsquo;t appear to be moving at all as Vincent crouched down next to him. Placing his fingers on Frank\u0026rsquo;s throat as he kept his eyes roving around the hangar. He sighed heavily when he detected a pulse in his friend\u0026rsquo;s veins.\nPulling up his holographic computer interface he tapped into the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s computer and accessed the security cameras. Calling up the camera replay for the cargo hold he saw the mysterious figure stagger to its feet and out the door into the hangar. Tapping a few keys, he switched to the external cameras where he saw Frank try to assist the staggering figure but he was violently tossed aside where he landed on the floor where he lay now. The figure made its way to the hangar\u0026rsquo;s interior pressure door and seemed to fiddle with the keypad for a moment before finally smashing through the door with several titanic overhead strikes.\n\u0026ldquo;Well now I know what that fusion power source and that damage to the crate were about. This person is obviously some kind of cyborg. But what the hell is going on?\u0026rdquo;\nQuickly he checked the time index on the camera feed and compared it to his own timepiece. There was a five-minute difference. For an instant he considered jumping aboard the Neophyte and getting the hell away from the place, but in the end he knew he couldn\u0026rsquo;t do that to these people. He may not live here any more, but he grew up here, and his mother was still here. He owed these people more than that.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit.\u0026rdquo; He sighed out loud as he made to stand up.\nA mumble from Frank stopped him cold as he returned his attention to his friend.\n\u0026ldquo;Frank. Do you need a medic?\u0026rdquo;\nFrank slowly rolled over onto his back and pressed his hands into his forehead. \u0026ldquo;The hell happened?\u0026rdquo; he mumbled through his forearms.\n\u0026ldquo;The person on my ship attacked you. Are you alright?\n\u0026ldquo;No I\u0026rsquo;m not alright!\u0026rdquo; Frank was suddenly full of vigor as he glared at Vincent. \u0026ldquo;I was just assaulted by some\u0026hellip;thing for doing someone a favor.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m really sorry Frank. They were unconscious for several hours on the way here. I don\u0026rsquo;t even know who they are\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Well you might think about asking next time before you pick up mutant hitch hikers.\u0026rdquo; Frank started to roll to his feet as he spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;No kidding.\u0026rdquo; Vincent agreed, grabbing his friend\u0026rsquo;s shoulders and helping up. \u0026ldquo;Look Frank, I\u0026rsquo;m really sorry. Axel slipped that\u0026hellip;person into a crate I was picking up for Lou. I found them en route to Lou\u0026rsquo;s and diverted here until we could figure out what was going on. I never meant\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFrank put a hand on Vincent\u0026rsquo;s shoulder and looked him in the eye. \u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Vin. Let\u0026rsquo;s just get them under control before someone else gets really hurt.\u0026rdquo;\nVincent nodded in agreement. \u0026ldquo;Did they say anything at all before they put you down?\u0026rdquo;\nFrank rand his fingers through his receding hair line as he thought about it. \u0026ldquo;Now you mention it, they did say something about\u0026hellip; a thorn maybe? It all happened so fast I\u0026rsquo;m not really sure\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s ok Frank. They\u0026rsquo;ve got about a seven minute head start on us. I\u0026rsquo;m going to see about tracking them down. You jump on a terminal and see if you can track them through the video system. Let me know if you find anything.\nFrank shivered a bit as he began moving awkwardly toward the hangar\u0026rsquo;s terminal. \u0026ldquo;Be careful Vin, whatever they are, they hit like a mass driver.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I will.\u0026rdquo; Vincent agreed as he eyed his handgun and made his way out of the hangar.\nAs it turned out, following the person was not much of a challenge. As Vincent made his way through the winding maze of corridors and connecting tunnels that made up the dregs. He encountered numerous people that had been injured as the stranger had made their way past, simply pushing people aside roughly, almost as if they didn\u0026rsquo;t exist as anything more than an obstacle. He also encountered several damaged pressure doors as he followed the path of mayhem away from the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s hangar.\nHis count of injured people had reached twenty before he encountered his first serious injury. A young man, in his late teens, had apparently tried to stand up to the stranger as they had pushed aside his sister. The result of his act of heroism seemed from Vincent\u0026rsquo;s quick evaluation, to be several broken ribs, a possible concussion, and, worst of all his right arm was broken in at least four different places, having been wrenched around behind his back and forced into something resembling a pretzel. He lay on the ground twitching and barely conscious as Vincent checked his pulse and made sure he was breathing, all the while keeping his own eyes on the corridor for any signs of trouble.\nMaking a quick call to the local medical response personnel, he informed them of the young man\u0026rsquo;s location and condition, then set off down the corridor again with a renewed sense of urgency.\nMoments later he heard the sound of metal being bent under some great pressure and quickened his pace until he reached the corner that seemed to be the origin of the sound. Peeking around the corner he saw the person pulling on a badly damaged pressure door, peeling one of its corners away from the frame of the doorway. One of their legs was propped up on the wall and both hands gripped the edge of the door and their back was arched steeply away. They grunted heavily as they pulled on the metal slab with some great effort, their voice coming out in a strange, reverberating combination of male and female tones.\nAfter a moment he stepped halfway around the corner, weapon at the ready and shouted authoritatively at them. \u0026ldquo;You there. Stop what you are doing and stand down!\u0026rdquo;\nThe stranger ignored him and kept wrenching the door from its frame with no small measure of success as it was now folded nearly in half. They shifted their grip to a point closer to the wall and renewed their efforts.\nVincent cleared his throat loudly and raised his voice as he tried once more. \u0026ldquo;Stop what you are doing and stand down or I will drop you where you stand!\u0026rdquo;\nAgain the figure ignored him so he clicked the safety off and slid his finger over the trigger. \u0026ldquo;Last chance. Stand down, or fall down, your choice.\u0026rdquo;\nSlowly he counted to five under his breath, hoping they would not make him shoot them. When he hit five he slowed his breathing and gently squeezed the trigger. The pistol\u0026rsquo;s report echoed up and down the hallways on both sides of the intersection as the armor-piercing slug tore into the figure\u0026rsquo;s right knee, sending a spray of some kind of fluid that was obviously not blood arcing away from the leg. The brief shower coated the wall in a layer of thick, viscous fluid before stopping abruptly.\nThe figure stopped their efforts on the door then and looked down at their wounded knee, then back up at Vincent. The strange wound that was in the center of their face before was now closer to the right side of their head, running directly over their right eye, making it look as though it had been gouged out by some rabid animal or industrial accident. Their light blue hair was now covering most of their head, having forced the silvery-grey strands to give up most of their purchase. The cobalt blue eye on the growing, feminine side of their face narrowed at him with a hateful look that made him shudder, but something about that female side of their face made Vincent think he had seen it before.\nNot giving him a moment to explore the strange feeling of recognition, the stranger turned toward him and began charging him down with a strange, stiff-legged gait that, while awkward, was closing the distance all too quickly.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit!\u0026rdquo; Vincent spat as he squeezed off several more rounds from his handgun. The enhanced projectiles slammed into the stranger\u0026rsquo;s lower legs, causing them to stagger halfway to where Vincent stood but they didn\u0026rsquo;t stop their menacing advance.\nTaking a step back, Vincent aimed a little higher and moved the selector switch on his weapon to the \u0026lsquo;auto\u0026rsquo; position. Mere feet away now, he squeezed the trigger and held it down, his weapon emptying the remaining rounds from its magazine in an instant. The small swarm of bullets slammed into the stranger\u0026rsquo;s upper body and head, forcing them to spin, heels over head, in mid air and slam into the metal deck plate with a resounding thunk that sounded more like someone had dropped a 300 pound sack of ball bearings than an actual body hitting the floor.\nAs the strange figure lay face down on the deck plates, two pools of liquid began to form underneath them. On their left, a large pool of blood, and on their right more of the viscous machine fluid. The two liquids began to slowly mingle together on the deck, forming an ugly black pool that began to clot as it cooled in the air.\nVincent replaced the magazine in his pistol and pulled the charging slide, loading the weapon once more, then cautiously approached the prone figure and gently prodded them with the toe of his boot.\nBefore he could react, the figure\u0026rsquo;s right hand snapped out from under them and snatched his ankle, squeezing it roughly and pulling on him so that he had a difficult time maintaining his balance. As he leaned back away from the person, adjusting his balance and trying to wrench his foot away from the iron-clad grasp.\nThe stranger raised their head and looked at him with their one good eye, narrowed viciously at him, then they spoke in their strange, male/female voice. \u0026ldquo;Thorindal\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "  Product Description  A great American author once wrote: Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from technology. Or something like that. In the late 90's, scientists at the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas discovered a link to the quantum world that allowed people to manipulate the energy of the universe with thought alone. Now, magic is everywhere and almost anyone is able to use it, with the proper license. It has elevated medicine, science, and culture to stratospheric heights and changed the face of our world. But magic isn't as new as people think. It's been with us for quite some time. And as the saying goes, with great power\u0026hellip; Ocelot is a world class assassin with a style all her own. She avoids connections, dislikes obligations, and would sell her own sister to the mob (but just that once) to avoid being drawn into someone else's drama. So, naturally, she is drawn in, and finds herself working with a mage to prevent a major corporation from throwing the delicate balance of science, magic, and the law out the window. Even though there is nothing she would rather do less, but a promise is a promise. And a promise to a dragon is... well, still a promise. But it's also a promise... TO A DRAGON!

	"content": "Name: Zyrk\nAge: 23\nGender: Male\nHeight: 5 feet, 9 inches standing tall.Usually slouching or hunched over so he looks to be closer to four feet, 6inches.\nSkills/Talents: Zyrk is an accomplished brawler, having learned the hard way how to defend himself and get what he needs. He is by no means a master martial artist or heavy-weight pugilist, but he can hold his own in a fight and is not at all opposed to \u0026lsquo;cheating\u0026rsquo; in order to win. Additionally, Zyrk has practiced the arts of pick pocketing, palming,and picking locks to the point that he can \u0026lsquo;make ends meet\u0026rsquo; with little to noactual \u0026lsquo;work\u0026rsquo; taking place. He is an accomplished sword fighter, although heprefers to use daggers or his trusty Ironwood Bastone when weapons are calledfor in a fight. He is quick on his feet, has an excellent sense of balance andcan scale most surfaces with little danger of falling or slipping (partially dueto the retractable claws in his finger tips). He is in peak physical conditionalthough by no means exceptionally strong. He speaks Mwene and Arcadian fluentlyand knows a few bits and pieces of various other languages since Arcadia is aport of trade, although he really can\u0026rsquo;t even have a basic conversation in any ofthem.\nPhysical Description: Zyrk is descendedfrom the Jaguar people of the deep Mwene jungles. As such he has a dark, goldentone to his fur and is mottled with randomly shaped, black rings across hisback, outer arms, and outer legs. His chest, stomach and inner arms and legs area much lighter and softer fur, closer to a cream or eggshell color. He hasbright, vibrant blue eyes and the tip of his left ear is split vertically abouthalf way down the length from an old fight that did not end the way he wouldhave hoped. He has well defined, sinuous muscles and is deceptively nimble forhis size, but nowhere near as strong as the majority of his people. His tail islong, about one and a half times the length of his legs and is stark white atthe very tip and lined with concentric black rings down the rest of the length.He has retractable claws in the tips of all of his toes and fingers. His choicein apparel is simple, often borderline poverty-stricken in appearance, althoughit is simply part of his carefully crafted image.\nPersonality: Zyrk tries to becompletely self-serving. He puts on an air of being a rogue, out for no one buthimself and doing whatever he needs to do in order to survive. He will steal,cheat, bribe, bully, coerce, and be generally unpleasant to just about anyone inorder to get what he wants or needs. However, he never lies to anyone, ever, andwill go out of his way to avoid killing anyone who has not shown a completedisregard for his own continued existence. He often leaves a portion of hisspoils where the truly poor/helpless can find them, usually in the form of food,clothing, and the occasional trinket or small value coins, but if he were askedhow he feels about those same people he will go on and on about how he despisesthem for not being willing to get up off their rears and make something of theirown lives. He normally has a charming personality and is quick to smile orlaugh, especially in the middle of a good brawl (he likes to think it isdisconcerting to his opponent).\nEquipment: Zyrk carries very little inthe way of actual gear, trying to keep things as simple as possible. He normallycarries a half dozen throwing daggers of no appreciable quality along with twofighting knives (about 10-12 inches long, curved blades, razor sharp on bothedges), and his Ironwood Bastone (two simple sticks, about 32 inches long and aninch and a half in diameter). He also will carry a length of strong, light ropeor cord when he is out robbing people\u0026rsquo;s homes in the night, just in case heneeds to tie someone up or make a hasty descent down the outside of a structure.\nHistory: Zyrk grew up in the jungles ofMwene where his tribe roamed the eternal twilight hunting and raiding othertribes and settlements. The jungle presented a difficult life at the best oftimes and Zyrk learned at an early age how to defend himself, as well as how totell when he was incapable of doing so. He spent his formative years prowlingthrough the jungle canopy, scouting ahead for the raiding parties, then throwingfirst sharpened sticks, then actual knives at any who tried to escape theirraids. When he came of age (at 15 years old) he decided to take his leave fromthe tribe and seek his fortune in the cities where he dreamed money rained downfrom the heavens. His tribe\u0026rsquo;s final gift to him was his coveted Ironwood Bastone,the ceremonial weapon of his kin. The Ironwood is a rare hardwood that growsscarcely in the jungles and is prized for its strength and weight.\nOnce on his own he made his way through Mwene and Erim to the Turquoise Sea andeventually to the cities of Arcadia where he quickly learned that a jungle wasstill a jungle regardless of what it was made from. Since then he has made alife for himself, stealing for what he needs to survive and trying to gounnoticed by anyone with any sort of power, because the one time he did getnoticed, things did not turn out the way he would have hoped\u0026hellip;\nThe time Zyrk got noticed\nIt was a cool morning in Arcadiaand Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s fur ruffled as the light sea breeze rolled over him from the bay. Hestretched languidly in the morning sun, taking a moment to survey the streetsfilling with people of all shapes and sizes below his rooftop abode. Turningback toward his roughly constructed rooftop shack, it wasn\u0026rsquo;t much, but there wasno landlord and the rent was cheap, as in non-existent. Leaning inside the shackhe picked up his belt and wrapped it around his waist, settling it on his hipsas he drew the buckle closed. Finally he reached through the door one last timeand removed the shoulder sheath that held his Ironwood bastone and slung it overhis shoulder as he moved toward the ladder that led discretely down to streetlevel in the alley behind the building.\nAs he entered the growing crowedof market-goers thronging through the street, his keen blue eyes immediatelywent to work, roving through the crowd for signs of easy prey. A fat canine witha drowsy look on his face as he stood in front of a merchant\u0026rsquo;s tent, shiftingfrom foot to foot made for a perfect beginning. As he walked past the wafflingshop patron he reached out with practiced ease and sliced the leather thongholding the man\u0026rsquo;s coin purse to his belt and slipped the heavy purse into hisown belt pouch as he moved away into the crowd.\nIt was near midday that ithappened. He had spied an easy mark drifting between street vendors, lookinglost and out of place on the crowded streets. He grinned under his hood, todaywas a good day indeed.\n\u0026ldquo;Welcome to Arcadia\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he thoughtto his target as he bore down on them with his usual stealthy approach.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s when it all went horriblywrong. Just as he reached out to cut his mark\u0026rsquo;s purse strings, the person spunaround and in one fluid motion clicked a thin but sturdy metal shackle aroundhis wrist. He was so stunned buy the event that h didn\u0026rsquo;t even think to resist ashis aggressor spun him around, twisting his manacled arm around behind his backand deftly secured his other arm there. Less than a minute later they weresafely sequestered away in a nearby alley, Zyrk with his shoulders and securedhands pressed against the wall and the angry bovine face of his former markpressed close to his own. The other\u0026rsquo;s nostrils flared as he glared into Zyrk\u0026rsquo;seyes menacingly.\n\u0026ldquo;Thought you had another easy markeh thief?\u0026rdquo; He growled through flat, brownish teeth as he tried with littlesuccess to press Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s body further into the stone wall behind him.\n\u0026ldquo;Sorry friend\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Zyrk gasped back,his body working overtime just to pull in enough oxygen to keep him conscious,\u0026ldquo;Think you\u0026rsquo;ve got th wrong guy\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe bovine grinned at that andshifted himself so his right forearm was braced across Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s chest, then leanedinto him with the considerable weight of his body. He then reached into Zyrk\u0026rsquo;spouch and withdrew several coin pouches bearing cut strings.\n\u0026ldquo;I suppose it would be pointlessto plead innocence at this point?\u0026rdquo; Zyrk tried to turn his grimace into a roguishgrin as he spoke.\n\u0026ldquo;You suppose correctly.\u0026rdquo; Thebovine responded with a grunt as he jammed the purses back into Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s beltpouch roughly.\n\u0026ldquo;Any chance we can talk this outlike civilized blokes?\u0026rdquo; He tried again.\n\u0026ldquo;None.\u0026rdquo; The bovine huffed as hegrabbed Zyrk by the shoulders and roughly yanked him off the wall. With theefficiency of an experienced jailer the bovine latched a length of chain to thelink between Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s manacles then roughly shoved him in the direction of thecrowded street, holding the other end of the chain firmly in his other hand.\nZyrk simply dropped his gaze tothe ground, hiding his face from the throngs on the street, and let his captordirect him through the use of rough shoves and grunts. There was no sense infighting back now, he would have to wait for a more opportune time to make abreak for it.\nTwenty minutes later they had leftmost of the market traffic behind and were moving through the slightly lessdirty streets of the older portion of the city. This was where the big money wasliving. Old blood with old coin, most of it begot at the point of a sword or apoison-laced drink at a banquet. Zyrk knew this because he spent the occasionallate night here, moving across the rooftops, slipping silently in and out oftop-floor windows and efficiently redistributing these \u0026lsquo;noble\u0026rsquo;s\u0026rsquo; wealth back tothe masses. Usually in the form of an evening on the town or a night at thebrothel.\nHowever there was one home hewould never have considered entering unbidden. That being the home of one of themerchant lords. The individuals who ran the free market in Arcadia. They werethe richest in the city, unless you counted the brothel owners, and were by farthe most attached to their money. They were the ones who maintained small,private armies of mercenaries and assassins. That, of course, being one of thehomes they turned up the path toward with a rough shove on his left shoulderthat nearly made him topple over as his body instinctively tried to keep himmoving past the hopeless situation that undoubtedly lay behind the front doorsof this abode.\nThe yard was huge and elaboratelydecorated, glittering and pristine compared to the gritty streets beyond thegarden wall. As they approached the front entrance, the doors drew aside,seemingly of their own accord, permitting them ingress into the grand entrywaybeyond. The room was nearly as large as the entire building that Zyrk had builthis hovel atop. There must have been three or four levels looking down into thecourtyard he found himself in, each with an open balcony wrapping all the wayaround the cavernous space. The entire courtyard was paved in smooth marble thatlooked to be imported from the other side of the world. The floor gleamed sobrightly that the lamps lighting the space beneath the balconies reflected withthe intensity of the afternoon sun, creating a halo of light coming up off thefloor and making it difficult to see through any of the numerous open doorslining the perimeter of the enormous room.\nWhen they reached the center ofthe room, Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s captor kicked him roughly in the backs of his knees, drivinghim unceremoniously to his knees on the hard stone floor. Zyrk grunted hisappreciation for the kind action of his new friend as he looked up in time tosee a large boar looking down at him. The boar was a dark brown color and hislumpy face was broken up at odd intervals with thick yellow-white tusks thatseemed to jut out at incomprehensible angles. Zyrk wasn\u0026rsquo;t sure he had ever seenanything quite like this person with their beady black-red eyes and twisted,massive teeth.\n\u0026ldquo;Nice day for a walk.\u0026rdquo; He tried tounsettle them with unexpected humor. \u0026ldquo;Although I must say that your friend hereisn\u0026rsquo;t much of a conversationalist really.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t pay Sorn for his wittyrepartee, Zyrk, is it?\u0026rdquo; The boar responded with an unsettling gleam in his eye.\n\u0026ldquo;Er\u0026hellip; Would there be any point inrefuting that accusation?\u0026rdquo; Zyrk looked around at the bovine Sorn standing behindhim, arms akimbo, the chain lead still held firmly in one of his hands.\n\u0026ldquo;Not as such, no.\u0026rdquo; The boarcommented idly as he began to pace around the center of the room. \u0026ldquo;You areprobably wondering what you are doing here\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Actually I thought we had a lunchdate. Are the appetizers on yet?\u0026rdquo; Zyrk did his best to follow the boar\u0026rsquo;smovements but in the end gave it up and began searching his surroundings for hisexit. Nothing seemed to be leaping out at him as being particularly appetizing.\n\u0026ldquo;No, in point of fact. They arenot.\u0026rdquo; The boar replied coolly. \u0026ldquo;And your attitude toward your predicament is, Imust admit, less than desirable. He pass\u0026eacute; din front of Zyrk as he finishedspeaking, jus tin time for Zyrk to see his thick, lumpy tongue dart out frombehind his misshapen teeth to lick his fat, brown lips, leaving a solid line ofstringy slobber dangling from tusk to tusk all the way around the boar\u0026rsquo;s face.\nIt was all he could to do keepfrom either retching on the spot, or laughing hysterically. \u0026ldquo;Well, I\u0026rsquo;ll tell youwhat, since I don\u0026rsquo;t seem to be here about liberated coin purses, how about youtell me why I AM here. That way we can both get back to our own lives as quicklyas is convenient for you.\u0026rdquo; He was pretty sure he actually HAD retched a bit\u0026hellip;\n\u0026ldquo;Very well then, since you insist.My name is Lord Byron, and I have had something taken from me that I want back.\u0026rdquo;\nAt that, Zyrk squared hisshoulders and straightened\u0026nbsp; his back. He was a lot of things but stupid was notone of them. He had never stolen from this Lord Byron before, and he knew thatfor fact. He liked his fur way too much to be that daft. This was not theinterrogation it had been made out to be\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;Fine, then how about you release meand we talk about this like adults, the part of the posturing egomaniac iscomplete wasted on me. I know who you are.\u0026rdquo; His tone was instantly serious, allbusiness now.\nThe boar stopped, seemingly takenaback by the change in Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s demeanor and voice. He seemed to consider thewords for a moment, rolling them around in his voluminous skull before finallyactually hearing them. \u0026ldquo;Very well. Sorn\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nA moment later, Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s hands werefree and he hoisted himself to his feet, straightening his clothing out as hemoved and slipping the hood off of his head. Finally he looked the boar in theeyes and bowed low. \u0026ldquo;Lord Byron. How can a simple beggar be of service?\u0026rdquo; Hedidn\u0026rsquo;t like it, but he knew that playing up to Lord Byron was the only way toget clear of the situation intact.\nLord Byron eyed him critically fora long moment before finally speaking again. \u0026ldquo;I have need of a person of your\u0026hellip;Moral latitude and skills.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk eyed him back a moment beforenodding silently to continue.\n\u0026ldquo;One of my rivals has taken apriceless treasure from me, the jewel of Mycen. The jewel is to be used in asacrifice to dark gods and I want it back.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk nodded his comprehension.\u0026ldquo;Who is this rival? And where does he keep the jewel?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He is Lord Haath. And he keepsthe jewel in a bedroom on the top floor of his estate in the northern portion ofthe city. My spies have seen the jewel sitting in solitude atop a velvet-covereddais through the window from afar. I want you to free the jewel and bring itback to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And in exchange for thisservice?\u0026rdquo; Zyrk responded coolly, folding his arms across his chest. \u0026ldquo;What ca Iexpect as compensation?\u0026rdquo;\nLord Byron raised a stubby eyebrowat him. It was difficult to tell if it was a gesture of respect for Zyrk\u0026rsquo;sbargaining, or one of disbelief at Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s audacity. \u0026ldquo;I could turn you over tothe city guard for the thief you are. I am sure they would love to put you onthe next penal ship bound for Myr.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;But if you do that, then youwon\u0026rsquo;t get your jewel.\u0026rdquo; Zyrk responded matter-of-factly.\n\u0026ldquo;I could just as easily find someother thief to retrieve it.\u0026rdquo; Lord Byron\u0026rsquo;s voice grew loud enough that it echoedoff the smooth marble walls and rolled up and down the myriad of hallwaysbranching from the room.\n\u0026ldquo;I don\u0026rsquo;t think so. Anyone who hasbeen here more than five minutes knows that Lord Haath is even less likely to betrifled with than yourself. You chose me because you must know something aboutme. If I had to guess I\u0026rsquo;d say that you know I never lie, and that I don\u0026rsquo;t carewho I steal from if the terms are right.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;If you will steal from anyone,then why have you not already robbed Haath blind? Or myself for that matter?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Because, despite my manycharacter flaws, I have not, to date, demonstrated any propensity for stupidity.As such, I have not stolen anything from anyone that would indicate that I haveactually taken a side in your little fiscal war. I remain neutral and I makesure that everyone knows it. So for me to do what you are asking, is for me tocast my lot in with you, which will change my ability to continue in thelifestyle to which I have become accustomed. That being the case, I would expectadequate compensation for such a perceived shift in loyalties. I can deal withthe city guards if I need to, but politics is another animal entirely.\u0026rdquo; At that,Zyrk actually put his feet up on the small table tha occupied the space betweenthem, crossed his legs and leaned the expensive wooden chair back on its rearlegs nonchalantly.\nLord Byron remained silent forseveral long moments after Zyrk finished speaking. Eyeing the Jaguar up and downwith an extremely critical eye. For the longest time Zyrk feared that he hadoverestimated this person and seriously overstepped his boundaries with hisbravado. Finally however, Lord Byron leaned back in his own chair, tossing hishead back and belting out a great peal of laughter that echoed even more fromthe marble walls of the great room. His laughter was such that he clutched hishands to his belly and held it firmly as he chortled and roared. After severalminutes more he finally pointed a hand shakily at Zyrk, still laughing with allhis might. \u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;I like you\u0026hellip; Zyrk\u0026hellip; you are\u0026hellip; a\u0026hellip; bold one\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; It took several more longminutes of belly laughing before he could calm down enough to actually speakintelligently again. With a simple motion from his hand, a try of steaming hot,flavored coffee was brought out by a serving girl and set on the table betweenthem.\nMotioning to the tray, Lord Byroncontinued speaking finally. \u0026ldquo;Very well then\u0026hellip; I shall grant you your weight ingold in exchange for this act.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk smiled as he leaned forwardand poured two cups of the steaming liquid. Offering one to Lord Byron, whoaccepted it with a friendly smile on his misshapen brown lips, then picked uphis own and, an instant after his hosted drank from his own cup, sipped at thecoffee himself. \u0026ldquo;That will do\u0026hellip; as a start\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nLord Byron almost choked on hiscoffee as the front legs of his chair slammed down on the marble floor and herolled forward in his chair, almost unseating himself. \u0026ldquo;For a start?! I waswrong about you. You are not bold. You are dimwitted!\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk\u0026rsquo;s smile widened as he lookedup from his cup. \u0026ldquo;That may be the case, but do not forget that it is I who haveit within my power to give you that which you desire. You may have brought mehere against my will, but it is I who has the upper hand at this table, and youwould be wise to realize that Lord Byron.\u0026rdquo;\nThe boar stood up angrily, wavingtoward his guards who began to race across the room toward Zyrk, who continuedto sit there calmly, feet propped up on the table. \u0026ldquo;Because not only can I getyou what you want, but I can make it look as though Lord Nyrrin is the onebehind the theft\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He took another sip of his coffee and enjoyed the look ofamazement that spread across Lord Byron\u0026rsquo;s face.\nAs the guards reached the sceneand began to grab at Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s shoulders and arms, Lord Byron raised his hand andstopped them cold, then whisked them away to the corners of the room once morewith a flick of his wrist. \u0026ldquo;How would you do such a thing?\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk smiled broadly at his host,winking as he did so. \u0026ldquo;That is a trade secret. You\u0026rsquo;ll just have to take it onfaith for now.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I see\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He gingerly sat down inhis chair once more, reaching for his coffee cup as he stared at Zyrk inamazement. \u0026ldquo;and what price would you place on such a deed?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;In addition to my weight ingold?\u0026rdquo; Zyrk drew the moment out as long as he thought he could safely make itlast. \u0026ldquo;Complete anonymity and autonomy from your house. I want you to neverspeak to anyone outside of this room of our business. Not your wife. Not yourmistresses. Not your children, or underlings, or business partners. Not anyone.And I want to never hear from you or any of your people ever again. If I do thisfor you, then I expect us to move on as ships in the night. I\u0026rsquo;ll continue notplying my trade in your back yard, and you\u0026rsquo;ll continue leaving me be, just likeit was yesterday or last week again.\u0026rdquo;\nLord Byron looked at himincredulously. \u0026ldquo; How could you say that? Surely you realize that the work Icould offer you would pay much better than anything else you could do on yourown\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course I realize that.However, I value my freedom, and certainly my life. Neither of which would bemine any longer if I was in your service full time. Better to be a beggar inArcadia than a prince anywhere else.\u0026rdquo;\nFinally Lord Byron offered a thinsmile of understanding and a faint nod. \u0026ldquo;I should have asked you to shake downsome of my delinquent accounts rather than retrieve my jewel. In less thanfifteen minutes you have become my equal at the bargaining table and bested meat debate. It would be nice to be able to keep tabs on one such as you. Give meyour word that you will never come to my door as an enemy and I will give youmine that your terms will be met.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk nodded confidently at theboar. \u0026ldquo;I give you my word that after the conclusion of our business I will nevercome into your home uninvited. Nor shall I ever do anything to undermine yourpower in Arcadia. I want nothing but to be left to my own devices, to make aliving for myself in my own way.\u0026rdquo;\nLord Byron nodded satisfactorily,hefting his weight back off the chair again and offering an open hand to Zyrk.\u0026ldquo;That is good enough for me.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk stood up lightly and graspedhis host\u0026rsquo;s hand firmly, looking the boar in the eyes as he gave the other asingle, confident shake. \u0026ldquo;Done and done. I will need two days. If I do notreturn by then, I am either dead or rotting in Haath\u0026rsquo;s dungeon.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Very well.\u0026rdquo; Lord Byron nodded ashe released Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s hand. Good luck to you.\u0026rdquo;\nWith that, Zyrk spun on his heelsand strode confidently out the door and back into the streets of Arcadia.\nZyrk had heard of activities thatmade time pass in a blur. In fact as a cub he had experienced a few suchactivities while playing with other cubs in his jungle home. The nexttwenty-four hours were anything but such an activity. He spent the better partof the day trying to find a vantage point from which he could take in LordHaath\u0026rsquo;s entire estate. He had to move once or twice in order to study all areasof the compound, for upon further reconnaissance he discovered that it truly wasa compound rather than a simple, albeit lavish, Arcadian home.\nLord Haath was truly prepared todeal with a small invasion force should such an event ever threaten him. Therewere regular patrols of guards throughout the gardens, regular postings of armedguards at entrances and choke-points throughout the winding pathways that ledfrom the high wall to the house itself. The pathways and walkways seemed to bedeliberately designed disorient and confuse for anyone at ground level, havingbeen surrounded with high, well manicured hedges and other plant life, not tomention walls, statuary, and other obstacles.\n\u0026nbsp;\nThe only straight, unobstructedapproach to the house was the main path from the street to the front door. Apath that had no less than twenty armed guards posted and patrolling its length.His salvation seemed to be in the form of the fact that it looked as though thebulk of his problems seemed to be located in the grounds, from what he couldtell through his observations the fighting forces inside the estate itselfseemed rather limited. He rarely spied an armed individuals moving about throughthe many windows and balconies of the home.\nAll through the first day and thatnight he watched, memorizing the guard\u0026rsquo;s shifts, patrol paths, post locations,the winding courses of the twisting garden paths and, as much as was possible,the interior layout of the home itself, even going so far as to locate the mostlikely room where the jewel would be kept, although the upper floors of the homehad most of their window shutters pulled closed so it was impossible to tell forsure where it was. By morning he was exhausted but had the beginnings of a planforming in his head. He took a couple hours to get some rest, then went shoppingfor what he would need to make his assault on Lord Haath\u0026rsquo;s estate.\nAs the sun began to set on thesecond evening, Zyrk climbed silently up to the top of the tallest structurenear the estate, a high bell tower. Carefully he secured the loose end of hisnewly acquired rope to the heavy iron framework that suspended the large bells,then he picked up the metal hook secured to the other end of the long line andtested its weight and balance at the end of a short stretch of rope. Taking amoment to center himself and line up his shot, he gave the short stretch of ropea couple of quick revolutions and let the hook fly free.\nThe grappling hook soared throughthe air and landed with a dull thud on the roof of the next tallest structurenear the estate, a cistern used for collecting rain water from the many oceanstorms that blew across the coastal cities of Arcadia. Pulling the rope taut,Zyrk secured his end tightly to the framework and then tested his weight againstthe line. He then made sure the rest of his equipment was secured to his person,grabbed the rope and hoisted himself up onto the line.\nSlowly he made his way, hand overhand, to the center of the rope where he rolled himself over and hooked his legsonto the rope, dangling upside down and looking to the ground below him toverify he was in the correct spot. Directly below him he saw his target, a largeoak tree in the corner of the garden of Lord Haath\u0026rsquo;s estate. The tree was notclose enough to any of the garden walls that it could be accessed from thestreet or the top of the wall, but from where he was, suspended in the airbetween two buildings, he had a direct shot at the ancient looking tree. Pullinghimself up, he slipped his next prepared length of rope from around hisshoulders and securely tied it to the center of the taut rope he as danglingfrom. Once the new line was secured, he let the coiled end drop and watched asit unrolled itself rapidly, finally reaching maximum extension with the enddangling down inside the uppermost leaves and branches of the oak tree belowhim. With a sigh he wrapped a turn of the new rope around his right hand andwrist then maneuvered one of his legs free of the supporting line and wrapped aturn of the vertical rope around it as well. Slowly he shifted his weight fromthe taut line to the dangling line until it was supporting his entire weight,then he pinioned his feet against one another on either side of the rope andbegan his slow descent toward the tree, heading face first so that he would beable to watch for any sign of guard activity as he made his way into thecompound.\nA few minutes later he was able tofree his hands from the rope in favor of finding purchase on the branches of thetree, then his feet transitioned to the strong branches and he was free of theprecarious rope, making his way down the tree and, finally, to the solid groundof the garden. Now came the difficult part of the evening\u0026rsquo;s activities. Silentlyhe crept through the garden, making his way from path to path, timing hismovements so that he would miss the patrols and hoping that his single day ofobservation was sufficient, normally he would spend several days casing alocation before moving in on it as there were so many ways that things couldvary from one day to the next. His timetable didn\u0026rsquo;t allow him the luxury of thatmuch planning and observation this time, and he hoped that the lack of it wouldnot come back to get him.\nThe trip through the garden waslong and tedious as he was forced to make frequent stops in order to allow theplacement of guard patrols to permit his passing between them unseen and on morethan one occasion he took a wrong turn and ended up in a dead-end cul-de-sac ormoving in circles. The sliver of the moon was high in the sky by the time hereached the base of the house where he meant to make his ascent to the upperlevels. Unfortunately the outside of the house seemed to have been designed toprevent people from climbing it and nothing had been permitted to grow closeenough to the home to allow it to be of any assistance. He would have usedanother grappling hook but the sound of the metal clattering along the roof or abalcony was sure to instantly attract the attention of the guards.\nInstead he had set up anotherlength of rope with a slip knot at one end in the same fashion as the people ofthe steppes that used their ropes to bring down charging or herding animals. Asquietly as possible he set the coil of rope on the ground and made sure that itoriented to allow it to uncoil as smoothly as possible. With the large loop inhis hand he tested the slip knot to make sure it was functioning properly thenlooked up to check his path up the wall. The way was clear up the sheer side ofthe home all the way to the third floor balcony that was his intended entrypoint and just above it was the roof with its chimney just visible past the eve.\nAfter the next patrol passed hislocation, Zyrk counted off the seconds until they would be around the corner atthe end of the path then stood up and started spinning the loop of rope causingit to open up into a wide circle. With a flick of his wrist he launched thelasso up toward the roof and yanked back on the trailing rope as it reached theapex of its arc, causing the rope to drop down around the chimney. With one morelook around for guard patrols he slipped up the wall, pulled the rope up behindhim and left it in a coil on the balcony as he slipped through the doors intothe interior of the house.\nIf the home of Lord Byron wasopulent, then that of Lord Haath was simply obscene. The walls were constructedof smooth, polished stone with veins of gold, silver, and platinum runningthrough them like they were marble, although the surfaces were very obviouslyhand-made. The floors and walls were lavished with expensive furs and tapestriesand the room in which he had entered there was a set of couches and chairssitting around low tables, all constructed of the finest quality of ebony andivory he had ever seen. The room appeared to be some sort of sitting room forentertaining guests and it had a set of large, double doors that led out of theroom. Quietly he crept across the space and gently leaned his ear against thedoor. The faint sound of breathing from the other side of the door told him allhe needed to know.\nSilently he crept toward one ofthe sofas and picked up a small pillow, then moved himself back to the doorwhere he set himself to one side, with his back against the jamb. Taking a deepbreath and holding it in, he tossed the pillow across the room where it collidedwith the wooden door to the balcony and forced it closed with a clatter. Amoment later the door to the hallway opened and canine poked his head over thethreshold. In one fluid motion, Zyrk reached up, grabbing the guard with onehand on either shoulder and leveraged his elbows into the man\u0026rsquo;s solar plexus.With a heave he rolled his weight forward and the guard\u0026rsquo;s feet came off theground and spun through the air in a wide arc. He landed on the hard stone floorwith a thud that forced the oxygen from his lungs and as he looked up withbleary, tear-filed eyes, Zyrk dropped to one knee and drove his fist full forceinto the guard\u0026rsquo;s stomach, causing him to exhale in a wheezy sort of gasp thatsounded like a water-logged pier straining under the force of an inbound ship.\nQuickly Zyrk rolled the guardover, blindfolded his eyes and tied his wrists together securely behind hisback, then repeated the process with his ankles. He then dragged him to thedarkened fireplace and rolled him over the hearth, using another length of ropeto tie him bodily to the iron grate at the bottom of the fireplace.\nIn a flash he was back at thedoor, peaking into the hallway. The sitting room he was in was on the corner ofthe house and the hallway outside stretched away in two different directions,one straight away from him, and the other to his left. The hallway stretchedaway from his door in two directions and appeared to be empty so he stepped out,pulled the door closed behind himself and crept down the hallway toward theopposite end, where there was a sharp turn to the left. At the end of the nexthall was a door on the right-hand wall where he suspected the jewel to be. Asuspicion that was now given more weight by the simple fact that there were twoarmed people guarding the door. Thankfully it was far enough away that theyhadn\u0026rsquo;t seemed to notice the sudden activity at this door.\nHaving suspected this would be thecase, he had planned his route in advance and with two quick steps he dashedacross the hall and into a door on the same wall as the one he sought to enter.The room he entered was a bedroom, again overly lavish in appointment andequipped with several sets of rings attached to the walls at various points anda few sets of chains dangling from the ceiling.\nHe shook his head as he glancedaround. \u0026ldquo;The things that make people tick\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he muttered under his breath as hecrossed the room and stepped out onto its balcony. With a few quick glances downat ground level he figured out where the guards were at and with a moment toestablish his timing, he took a few quick steps and leapt the distance from hisbalcony to the next one over. This wall of the estate seemed to be occupiedprimarily by bedrooms, which all had balconies. Two more quick jumps and he wasoutside the room he sought.\nChecking the door for sounds fromwithin, he heard the faint sound of breathing, but it was not coming from nearthe door so he would have to enter the room and deal with whatever was therewithout advanced preparation. Quietly he slipped his fighting knife from itssheath and stalked through the door, holding the knife with the blade pointingtoward the floor and leading with his left hand.\nThe room was another bedroom,nowhere near as well-appointed as the last one he had passed through. This roomhad its stone floor mostly bare and the walls were devoid of the tapestries hehad seen previously. There was a simple bed against one wall, two chairs oneither end of a small coffee table on the opposite wall and in the center of theroom stood a low dais, only one step up with a large velvet pillow atop it.Sitting calmly in the center of the pillow was a young woman. She was obviouslyof Lynx descent, her fur was pale and her pointy ears had dark tips with longtufts of fur arcing off of them. She was clad in a garment of wispy silk andsat, cross-legged in the center of the pillow with her arms folded in her lap,facing the door to the hallway.\nZyrk crept into the room, knife inhand and eyes darting about, searching for trouble. As he approached the daisthe woman whispered to him in a sweet melodic tone that sent a wave down hisspine. \u0026ldquo;Lord Byron has sent you to me.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;He sent me for the Jewel ofMycen, it was said to be in this room resting on a dai\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Then it occurred to himthat it had been his mistake to assume the jewel was a gem. With a sigh he slidhis dagger back into its sheath and moved around in front of the woman. \u0026ldquo;You arethe Jewel of Mycen?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I am.\u0026rdquo; She replied simply.\n\u0026ldquo;Well, this is going to complicatemy exit plan a bit\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he said as he looked around the room for anything thatmight be of use.\n\u0026ldquo;You assumed the jewel to be astone?\u0026rdquo; She said, casting her emerald green eyes on him as she spoke.\nHe stopped for a moment, allthoughts driven from his head as he gazed upon her beauty. \u0026ldquo;Uhhh\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He managed tobarely get past his lips.\nShe looked at him for a longmoment, her beautiful eyes boring into his soul. \u0026ldquo;He so often does not offerinformation that is not specifically asked for.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Yeah, I\u0026rsquo;ll have to remember tobring that up the next time I see him. In the mean time however, I think we needto work on a plan to get you out of here.\u0026rdquo; Zyrk did his best to not look at her,knowing that to do so would distract him again and that was the last thing heneeded right now.\n\u0026ldquo;I am at your service.\u0026rdquo; She bowedher head as she responded in her delicate whisper, then stood up in one fluidmotion that reminded Zyrk of the ballet dancers he had seen in the public forumon many an occasion. \u0026ldquo;What is your plan master\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk looked at her for a momentlonger than he thought in retrospect would have normally been appropriate then,\u0026ldquo;Zyrk.\u0026rdquo;\nShe bowed her head once more inhis direction. \u0026ldquo;Very well Master Zyrk. What is your plan?\u0026rdquo;\nHe offered her a quirky grin.\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s just Zyrk. I am no one\u0026rsquo;s master.\u0026rdquo;\nHer fur ruffled a bit inembarrassment. \u0026ldquo;Be that as it may, until I am back in my father\u0026rsquo;s home, I amyour servant.\u0026rdquo;\nHe was about to rebuff her againwhen an idea occurred to him\u0026hellip; \u0026ldquo;I think a plan is forming\u0026hellip; Could you please knockon the door and get the guards to come in here for me?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Of course Master Zyrk.\u0026rdquo; Shereplied as she bowed her head again. She then made her way to the door as hemoved himself to the side of the door and drew his bastone from their leatherpouch across his back.\nShe moved up to the door and,seeing him nod his readiness, tapped lightly on the wooden surface, then took astep back so as to be clear of the door as it swung open.\nOne of the guards, a feline ofsome spectacular muscle mass leaned his head through the door and eyed hersuspiciously. \u0026ldquo;What do you want?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I need my pillow moved closer tothe balcony so that I may bathe my body in the light of the moon.\u0026rdquo; She repliedin a melodic tone, stepping back and pointing to the dais.\n\u0026ldquo;We are not your personalfurniture movers.\u0026rdquo; The cat replied angrily.\nShe smiled demurely, \u0026ldquo;Lord Haathwants me stress free and accepting of my fate does he not?\u0026rdquo;\nThe guard glared at her and noddedhis head slightly.\n\u0026ldquo;Then please move my pillow closerto the balcony so that I may bathe my person in the light of the moon. Itsoothes my spirit.\u0026rdquo;\nThe big cat\u0026nbsp; glared at her again,looking back and forth between her slight figure and the heavy dais in thecenter of the room. Finally he looked back out of the room and jerked his headin the direction of his companion and the pair strode into the room and towardthe heavy stone structure.\nAs they cleared the threshold Zyrkquietly closed the doors behind them and slid the bolt home, then slipped upbehind the guards as they plodded unsuspectingly toward their headaches. With aquick motion, Zyrk brought one of his bastone down on the side of each of theirheads. The smooth cylindrical wooden sticks collided with the flesh and fur ofhis targets and created a sickening thumping sound upon impact, followed by thesound of a heavy body collapsing to the ground in a heap.\nThe second body completely failedto hit the ground due to the fact that it had completely failed to fall at all.The large cat staggered forward, then spun around with a short sword in hishand, swinging it in a wide arc at exactly the level of Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s neck. With speedhoned through countless fights, Zyrk dropped into a squatting stance, narrowlydipping under the blade as it nicked the hairs at the tips of his ears. From hisnew vantage point he cut loose with a flurry of strikes with his bastone,targeting the guard\u0026rsquo;s left knee and upper thigh.\nThe guard dropped to his kneeswith a yelp of pain, but seemed more determined than ever to relieve Zyrk of hishead and took another wide swing with his still tightly clenched blade. Bringinghis own weapon up in response, Zyrk drove the wooden shaft full force into theguard\u0026rsquo;s forearm. The quick blow was not nearly enough to break his bones, but itwas more than sufficient to get him to let go of his sword, sending theimplement skittering across the shiny stone floor. Not stopping for an instant,Zyrk followed up the disarming blow with a series of quick strikes to the guardstemples, finally causing him to crumple to the ground in a heap.\n\u0026ldquo;They must have picked him up inthe underworld somewhere. I\u0026rsquo;ve never met a cat that stubborn before.\u0026rdquo; He intoneda he caught his feet again. He smiled at the jewel as he moved toward the door,sliding the catch back and opening the door a crack to peek into the hallway.But before he could get a glimpse of anything a fast-moving knuckle sandwich methis face. The gloved fist came in through the gap in the door and drove into hisface with an alarming amount of force. Zyrk rolled backward off his feet andLord Byron\u0026rsquo;s daughter gasped as he curled into a ball and rolled heels overhead.\nAs Zyrk rolled back into thecenter of the room the door was kicked open and through the door stalked ahulking brute of a bovine, adorned in the most stylish of shredded leathershirts any street beggar could ever hope to own. The brute was easily eight feettall and weighed four hundred pounds and his muscles would easily account forninety percent of that weight. His hands and forearms were clad in thick,hardened leather that was studded at odd intervals with metal spikes and studsand there was a large gold ring looped through his left ear. \u0026ldquo;Sit jewel. I willtake out your garbage.\u0026rdquo; The creature grunted as it advanced on Zyrk.\nOr his part, Zyrk had been able toabsorb some of the shock of the punch by throwing himself backward off his feetand tucking into a backward somersault. However, the damage the punch hadactually inflicted was nothing to laugh at. As he rolled back to his feet, in acrouching position, blood poured from his somewhat flattened nose and his lefteye began to darken beneath the short fur covering his face. His head swam a bitas he caught his balance but his weapons remained firmly in his grip. In adesperate bid to get the upper hand against his new adversary he launchedhimself, shoulder first at the guard, driving the hard point of his shoulderinto the bull\u0026rsquo;s solar plexus with all the strength of his legs.\nHis body collided with the guard\u0026rsquo;sand elicited a slight grunting noise, but didn\u0026rsquo;t seem to do much more than makehim stop moving forward for a second or two. Looking down his chest at Zyrk, theguard narrowed his eyes and then brought his arms together across his chest inan attempt to catch Zyrk in a bear-hug.\nZyrk dropped to his back, narrowlyavoiding the bovine\u0026rsquo;s arms, then kicked his legs up and pushed up with hisshoulders, arms and kicked out with his extended legs, driving his feet upwardinto the bottom of the guard\u0026rsquo;s chin. This got the guard staggering backward,which gave Zyrl a the chance to spin around and drive his bastone into theguard\u0026rsquo;s knee with all his strength.\nThe guard dropped to one knee witha grunt, then looked up at Zyrk, a malicious gleam in his eye as he cocked backhis right arm and lashed out with a vicious uppercut. \u0026ldquo;Get back, worm.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk grunted as the fist connectedwith his jaw and lifted him bodily off the ground, sending him sprawlingbackward where he landed in a heap on top of the cushioned dais and flipped overonce more, rolling down the slight rise to the stone floor.\u0026nbsp; The guard regainedhis feet with no apparent discomfort at all, while Zyrk struggled even to figureout which direction was up. His head was spinning and there was a terribleringing noise in his ears as he staggered to his feet, clutching his bastone inhis weakened grip. \u0026ldquo;Is that the bessst you got\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; He slurred through hisswelling jaw.\n\u0026ldquo;Come back over here and we\u0026rsquo;llsee.\u0026rdquo; The guard snarled at him, nostrils flaring with contempt.\nZyrk stumbled forward, making hisway shakily around the dais. As he passed the Jewel, he winked at her with hisunswollen eye, causing her to conceal a strange gasp/giggle sound behind herhands.\u0026nbsp; \u0026ldquo;Arigh\u0026hellip; les\u0026rsquo;sss ssee wha\u0026rsquo;cher godd\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; he slurred as he looked back at theguard.\nAs he moved within the range ofthe bovine\u0026rsquo;s impressively long arms, the guard reached out with both hands,apparently making a bid to squeeze Zyrk\u0026rsquo;s head between his massive hands. In asudden burst of speed however, Zyrk lunged forward, slipping between the guard\u0026rsquo;shands and driving the blunt end of one of his bastone into the guard\u0026rsquo;s righteye.\nThe room filled with a roar ofpain and rage that shook the fixtures and rattled the window shades. Wasting notime however, Zyrk spun around, placing several precisely aimed blows with hisbastone. Calves, knees, thighs, and lower back as he spun in a wild arc aroundbehind the reeling guard. When the bovine dropped to his knees again, stillclutching his bleeding eye socket, Zyrk brought down a series of hammering blowson the hulking guard\u0026rsquo;s shoulder where it met the neck.\nFinally, Zyrk stopped moving,standing in a fighting stance several feet from the guard, bastone at the readyin a defensive position and squinting through his swollen eye at the now silentbull who finally fell face forward to the floor.\nZyrk sighed in relief as the Jewelran across the room and threw her arms around his body, squeezing him tightly.\u0026ldquo;I thought you were going to be killed.\u0026rdquo; She gushed.\nZyrk smiled at her, ignoring thepain in his jaw. \u0026ldquo;I had him right where I wanted him the whole time.\u0026rdquo;\nWith that he pulled free of herembrace and moved across the room to the balcony, peeking out for a long momenthe finally caught sight of the reflected moonlight that was his pre-arrangedsignal. A moment later he grabbed one of the hanging braziers from the wall andtook it out to the balcony where he spun it around in two large circles,creating a glowing circle of light on the balcony. Finally he launched thebrazier up into the air as high as he could and rushed back into the room, notwaiting for it to come down again before he grabbed the Jewel by her upper armand moved her to the hallway door.\n\u0026ldquo;Ok, we are going to have to move,and move quickly to make this work. Do not stop unless I tell you to or we aredone for. We are heading straight for the front door and out the gate. Anyquestions?\u0026rdquo; His speech was much better now that his head had cleared up a bitfrom the earlier attack.\nShe shook her head no, then turnedto face the door, slightly behind her rescuer, setting her face in a determinedlook, lips pressed tightly together, and ears swept back from her head.\n\u0026ldquo;Alright, here we go.\u0026rdquo; Zyrkannounced as he pushed the doors open and they moved out into the hallway.\nThey made it to the main stairwaybefore encountering their first resistance, which Zyrk brushed aside withrelative ease, rolling unconscious bodies down the stairs ahead of them afterthe brief encounter. By the time they reached the second floor, just one abovethe main level, a ruckus could be heard outside in the garden. It sounded asthough there was a battle raging outside the house walls, and any guards theyencountered seemed to be rushing toward the sound of the altercation, ratherthan looking for the escaped Jewel.\nTwo more quick fights saw them atthe front door and within a few more minutes they were winding their way throughthe streets of the harbor city, the din of combat fading quickly behind them.\nWhen they finally stopped to catchtheir breath, Zyrk slid his bastone into the leather sheath across his back ashe leaned heavily against the wall o the alley they had secreted themselveswithin. \u0026ldquo;Are\u0026hellip; you\u0026hellip; alright\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo; He panted.\n\u0026ldquo;Yes\u0026hellip; I believe\u0026hellip; I will be\u0026hellip; fine\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;She replied breathily. \u0026ldquo;What\u0026hellip; happened\u0026hellip; to the\u0026hellip; guards\u0026hellip;?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026hellip; procured some assistance\u0026hellip; thismorning before I went in after you\u0026hellip; I always try to have a back-up plan, plus Itold your father I would make it look as though Lord Nyrrin had taken you.\u0026rdquo; Hisbreath was coming under control now.\n\u0026ldquo;How did you get Lord Nyrrin toattack Lord Haath?\u0026rdquo; She raised an eyebrow at him, ears perked up curiously.\n\u0026ldquo;I didn\u0026rsquo;t. I hired a group ofmercenaries to disguise themselves as Nyrrin\u0026rsquo;s men and storm the estate.\u0026rdquo; Zyrksmiled as her bright, green eyes looked into his own blue pools.\n\u0026ldquo;That was\u0026hellip; very clever of you\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;She finally whispered as they drew closer to one another by barely perceptibleamounts.\n\u0026ldquo;I have been told that I have myclever moments\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He replied, leaning toward her as her scent filled hisnostrils. His ears twitched a bit as their lips finally met and they kissedpassionately for several long moments.\nWhen they finally broke off thekiss, they were both panting for breath again and an uncomfortable silence fellbetween them. It was another long minute before Zyrk finally spoke up, turningto face the main street that their secluded alley opened up onto. \u0026ldquo;We should getmoving. I only have a few hours before I am supposed to return you to LordByron.\u0026rdquo;\nOver the course of the next fewhours they made their way through the dark shadows and deep recesses of the cityas they moved inexorably toward Lord Byron\u0026rsquo;s estate on the other end of thecity. They chatted briefly whenever they would stop for a rest and whenever theycaught one another\u0026rsquo;s eyes they would find themselves staring at length, and onnumerous occasions they were forced to stop themselves in the middle of apassionate kiss. Zyrk had never felt this way about anyone before, and he wassure she was feeling the connection as well.\nAs they approached the gates ofLord Byron\u0026rsquo;s estate, still out of earshot of the guards there, Zyrk stoppedsuddenly and turned to face her with a serious look darkening his normallycheerful face. Even through the swollen eye and jaw, she could tell that he wascontemplating something quite serious.\n\u0026ldquo;Listen. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure how yourfather would react, but I need to tell you before this is over that I think I amfalling for you.\u0026rdquo; He looked at his feet as he spoke, unsure that he could handleher response, not wanting to see her face if she thought he was a fool.\nWhen he felt her hand lift hischin until their eyes met his heart nearly stopped. Her face was one of love andadoration, and a tear was forming in her eye as she smiled. \u0026ldquo;I think I amfalling in love as well Master Zyrk. It is a most unfortuitious outcome as mydestiny is already decided.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk shook his head slightly. \u0026ldquo;Runaway with me. I have already decided to leave the city when this is over. LetLord Byron keep his pile of gold and we can disappear into the jungles.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I cannot. I have a destiny, andit must be fulfilled.\u0026rdquo; Her face grew soft, compassionate, as his eyes clouded.\nHe looked away from her again,unable to face her eyes. \u0026ldquo;Well\u0026hellip; Maybe I can stop by\u0026hellip; we can see each otheragain\u0026hellip; talk about it\u0026hellip; I\u0026rsquo;ll get you to change your mind\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nHer face changed again then. Ittook him a moment to realize what it was she was conveying. Then it hit him. Itwas pity. There was something else going on here that she was not telling him.\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m sorry Master Zyrk. I will beleaving tomorrow night, with the full moon. The time is almost past and I MUSTfulfill my own destiny.\u0026rdquo; Her voice was soft, pleasant, and while there was somepain there, it was filled mostly with the pity that he did not quite understand.\n\u0026ldquo;If it is about my being a thief\u0026hellip;I can change. I\u0026rsquo;ll open up a shop or\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; He had never even considered something somundane as a way of life before, but he couldn\u0026rsquo;t really stand the thought of hergoing away with some betrothed husband when he knew they had fallen in love withone another.\n\u0026ldquo;That will be quite out of thequestion I\u0026rsquo;m afraid.\u0026rdquo; A bold, male voice shattered the moment. Zyrk looked up tosee Lord Byron and several of his goons lined up between them and the estate.\u0026ldquo;The Jewel must be prepared at once.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Father.\u0026rdquo; She said flatly as shebowed low to him.\n\u0026ldquo;You. Take her to her room andprepare her for the sacrifice.\u0026rdquo; Lord Byron hollered as he gestured at two of histhugs. The two immediately snapped to and began moving in on her.\nIn a flash Zyrk was between them,bastone in hand and ready for a brawl. \u0026ldquo;Go!\u0026rdquo; He shouted over his shoulder. \u0026ldquo;Makea break for it and I\u0026rsquo;ll hold them off!\u0026rdquo;\nThe goons snarled at him, baringtheir teeth and flexing their hands around their now drawn swords. They took atentative step toward Zyrk but were stopped when she softly rested her hand onZyrk\u0026rsquo;s shoulder, completely disarming the situation. He turned to face her witha questioning look.\n\u0026ldquo;I told you Master Zyrk. I have adestiny to fulfill. Did my father not tell you that I was to be sacrificed?\u0026rdquo; Thelook on her face was one of complete serenity and acceptance.\nZyrk was stymied. \u0026ldquo;He\u0026hellip; uh\u0026hellip; He didsay that, but I thought\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nShe smiled at him. A warminviting, caring smile. \u0026ldquo;You assumed it was Lord Haath that was going to offerup the sacrifice\u0026hellip; I understand. It was a simple enough mistake to be made. Butnow that you are aware of the circumstances we can all go about our business.\u0026rdquo;\nZyrk nodded his head dumbly for amoment before he realized what was going on. Then he stepped back from her andspun around to face the thugs again, this time his face was contorted in avisage of pure anger. \u0026ldquo;They\u0026rsquo;ve bewitched you m\u0026rsquo;lady. I won\u0026rsquo;t let them do this.Stay behind me and we\u0026rsquo;ll get you to someone who can help.\u0026rdquo;\nThe goons advanced on him as hestood against them, bastone raised. As they moved into range he was inmid-swing, about to brain one of the thugs, when it happened. He was so involvedin the people in front of him that he didn\u0026rsquo;t notice what was going on until itwas too late.\nIn a flash, the Jewel of Mycensnatched one of the fighting knives from his belt sheath and struck out like abolt of lightning. Zyrk saw the expression on one of his adversary\u0026rsquo;s faceschange and out of instinct, ducked down low, which caused the blade to miss thecenter of his back. Instead, the blade sliced cleanly through the skin of hisleft ear about half way up, then sliced the ear cleanly in half as his momentumcarried the blade out the top of his head. Zyrk winced in pain as his sensitiveflesh was bifurcated, and his hesitation gave the thugs all the time they neededto close in on him.\nHe had never suffered such abeating in his entire life. It had taken him months to get his strength back,and when it was over he was certainly in no shape to be dashing in and rescuingany misguided women. In reality he had been more than lucky to have survived thefirst few nights after the incident. They had left him there. Broken andbleeding in the streets of Arcadia. He had crawled out of the street and takenrefuge in the dark alleys and sewers until he had the strength to make his wayback to his rooftop shack where he spent his days and nights in feverednightmares, imagining the torturous ways in which her soul had been sent to thebeyond.\nZyrk sighed as he sat on the edgeof the roof looking out over the setting sun and the glorious light show itcreated on the calm water of the harbor. His heart ached, and his soul had arend in it that was mirrored in his perfectly bisected ear. He feared he wouldnever again be whole, and he felt certain that he would similarly never againallow himself to fall in love. If this was what it was to be in love, he didn\u0026rsquo;tthink his heart, or his body, could survive the journey\n"

	"content": "Vincent recoiled in near horror. The name tripped circuits in his brain that for some reason had kept him from seeing it before. He stumbled backwards, loosing his balance due to the hand clasping his ankle tightly and falling backwards onto his haunches roughly.\nNow it all came slamming in on him in crystal clarity, the female half of the face, the hair, the frame, it all looked so obvious now, now that that simple word had been uttered. Thorindal\u0026hellip; The female portion of this strange creature before him bore an almost identical appearance to his lover, Riana. The only differences were the color of the hair and eyes. Riana\u0026rsquo;s were dark purple and violet respectively, but this strange creature\u0026rsquo;s female features were very different in color, being icy, pale blue. How could this be? How could this strange person that was smuggled into his ship seemingly be transforming into a virtual clone of his Riana?\n\u0026ldquo;The hell are you?!\u0026rdquo; he finally managed as he yanked har on his restrained leg. The hand encircling his ankle felt like a vise, although he was able, with no small degree of discomfort, to wrench it free. Scrambling back, away from the person, until his back came into contact with the rough hewn stone wall of the corridor. He tightened his grip on his pistol and , bracing his back against the rough wall, slid himself to a standing position, bringing th weapon to bear on the person once more.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;thooriinndaaal\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The raspy, half male, half female voice said again. As the person attempted to ge their arms beneath them and push themselves up from the metal deck plates of the floor, but their hands slipped out form underneath them in the slick pool of blood and hydraulic fluid and they smashed down face first into the deck again.\n\u0026ldquo;What about Thorindal? Who are you? How do you know her?\u0026rdquo; Vincent quickly reloaded his pistol as he spoke, never taking his eyes off the heap of a person on the floor in front of him.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;thorindaaal, did thissss to meeeeee\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; The disturbing voice issued forth again, grating down Vincent\u0026rsquo;s spine like a sharp metal implement.\n\u0026ldquo;No chance. She wouldn\u0026rsquo;t\u0026hellip; even if she knew how\u0026hellip;. You\u0026rsquo;re seriously sick\u0026hellip; Let me get you a cyber-doc\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;NOOOOOO\u0026rdquo; The mixed voice screamed suddenly as the figure unexpectedly launched themselves to their feet and lunged across the short distance to where Vincent was still propped against the wall.\nVincent partially dodged to the side, catching a glancing blow from the figure\u0026rsquo;s right fist. The blow fell on him like a hammer, even as a partial connection, spinning him around on his feet and forcing him to stagger again to catch his balance. Before he could retaliate, the creature had launched itself at him once more, arms stretched out in front of hit in an attempt to encircle his neck.\nOn instinct, he ducked under their hands and rolled forward, bowling them over as he rolled through, knocking their legs off the floor. He didn\u0026rsquo;t excape without a scratch though, as he caught one of the creature\u0026rsquo;s feet in the small of his back. The impact sent him sprawling face first, his gun skittering across the floor as his hand reflexively released it to save his face from the floor.\nVincent moved as fast as he could, rolling to the side and kicking out with his feet for elevation. He kipped up onto his feet and jumped back again, putting more distance between himself and the stranger. Glancing around for his pistol, he saw that it had somehow gone the other direction and was now on the floor, some fifteen feet away, with the stranger between him and it.\nGrudgingly he reached around behind his back and slipped his bolt caster out of its holster there, bringing the massive, two inch bore to bear on his opponent.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026hellip;\u0026hellip;know\u0026hellip; thooorinndaaal\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; The person hissed as they tried to get back to their feet again, slipping and siding in the spilled fluids.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s between she and I. Now, this bolt caster is loaded with traditional shells. Which means we\u0026rsquo;re both in a lot of trouble if it goes off. But I have family and friends here, and I won\u0026rsquo;t let you hurt them, so now would be a great time to call off all this nonsense and wrap up the day on a high note.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thorindaaal, mussst paaayyy!!!\u0026rdquo; the person screamed as they launched themselves at him again.\nVincent was ready for it this time, he juked to the right, bringing his elbow down on the person\u0026rsquo;s neck as they dove past him.\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;He brought his elbow down with nearly his full body weight behind it, saving only enough to not put himself on the floor again. His arm screamed out at him as it collided with the metal bones and toughened skin of the person, but the result was still to his liking, the creature, toppled face first into the deck again, sliding to a stop some ten feet away.\nSnatching the opportunity, Vincent dove forward, snapping up his pistol midway through a sommersault. He roled to his feet and spun around to face the recovering person as they were staggering back to their knees.\n\u0026ldquo;yeah. I know her. We\u0026rsquo;re good friends Riana and I. And I\u0026rsquo;ll be DAMNED if I am going to let the likes of you get after her. Whatever you re!\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;Then he raised his bolt caster\u0026rsquo;s massive barrel toward the mangled pressure door and pulled the trigger. The small cannon belched with a jerk of his arm and the huge projectile collided with the door an instant later, resulting in an explosion that shook the whole asteroid. When the dust began to clear, Vincent pulled himself to his feet, doing his best to ignore the piercing klaxons and sirens going off all around him all of a sudden.\nQuickly he holsterd his pistol and\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;tapped his comm. \u0026ldquo;Frank, you there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;I\u0026rsquo;m here Vin. What the hell as that?\u0026rdquo; Frank\u0026rsquo;s voice rasped across the circuit.\n\u0026ldquo;Old school.\u0026rdquo; Vincent chirped back into the comm. as he watched his adversary pulling themselves back to their feet again, this time from underneath a small pile of mangled deck and ceiling plates, and a quarter ton of rocky debris. With a flick of his thumb, the barrel of the bolt caster popped open, dropping forward away from the handle on a hinge, allowing him to see clear through the weapon. Quickly he stripped another hand-grenade sized round from his shoulder harness and dropped it soundly into the back of the weapon. \u0026ldquo;I need you to clear out \u0026lsquo;g\u0026rsquo; sector and set me up for a \u0026lsquo;Suicide Scottie\u0026rsquo; in airlock 12a.\u0026rdquo;\nThe line was disturbingly silent for a long moment. With a jerk of h is wrist, Vincent flipped the barrel of his weapon closed with a resounding click. The stranger was back on their feet now, leaning heavily against the pulverized wall for balance. Finally Frank\u0026rsquo;s voice came back over the comm..\n\u0026ldquo;Vin\u0026hellip; What the hell are you into over there?\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Stop stalling and do it Frank! I don\u0026rsquo;t have time for this.\u0026rdquo; He was backing down the hallway toward the now-missing pressure door, the angry stranger staggering after him in a broken, labored gait.\n\u0026ldquo;Shit\u0026hellip; Alright. I need sixty seconds to clear out the sector.\u0026rdquo; Frank\u0026rsquo;s mind was obviously made up now.\n\u0026ldquo;That\u0026rsquo;s more like it Frank. Ive me a fifteen second count down.\u0026rdquo; Vincent tried his best not to trip over any of the rubble and debris in the hallway as he backed through the ex-doorway into a large room that was filled with shipping crates similar to the one that had started this mess.\nAs he slowly backed through the room, the stranger staggered after him, seething out loud about the unfairness of its miserable existence. Vincent slowly unfurled a short lanyard from his belt and clipped it onto the handle of his gun, attaching the weapon to him securely.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;kiillll thoooriinnndaaaal\u0026hellip;.\u0026rdquo; They muttered as they advanced on him.\nVincent\u0026rsquo;s back came up against the far wall of the room and he set his back against it, raising the bolt caster, and pointing it at the on-coming person, now less then twenty feet from him and still slowly advancing.\n\u0026ldquo;Fifteen seconds.\u0026rdquo; Frank\u0026rsquo;s voice echoed through the comm..\n\u0026ldquo;It\u0026rsquo;s going to be close\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Vincent murmured\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;under his breath.\nThe misshapen person staggered forward, fifteen feet away. \u0026ldquo;Killll thoorriiinaaall\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Ten seconds\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo; Came Frank\u0026rsquo;s voice.\nIt was now barely more than ten feet away. Vincent leveled the weapon at the person\u0026rsquo;s deformed head.\n\u0026ldquo;Five seconds\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;Thoooriinnnndaaaallll\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;three\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nFive feet. Vincent began to sweat as he reached his left hand toward the small control panel on his right forearm.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;two\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nThe person was no more than three feet away, its face mere inches from the barrel of Vincent\u0026rsquo;s weapon. In a burst of speed, Vincent ducked under the person\u0026rsquo;s grasping hands and rolled to the left. Bringing up his weapon, he tapped the control on his sleeve, causing the gloves and helmet to grow up out of his clothing. With his other hand he took aim at the far wall of the room and pulled the trigger.\nThe stranger reacted almost instantly, diving after him as he rolled.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;one\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nIt began to wrap its fingers around his ankle again as his helmet sealed itself, locking him into his own, private environment, and the projectile launched from his weapon slammed into the far wall of the room, latching into the stone there, the thin cable that had paid out behind it suddenly growing taut as the slack was pulled out.\n\u0026ldquo;\u0026hellip;now!\u0026rdquo;\nSuddenly the room turned into a nightmare. The wall they were laying against suddenly cracked open and swung outward, exposing the room to the vacuum of space. In a flash the air began rushing out of the room, jerking them both violently along with it. Shipping crates broke loose from their anchors and moorings and rushed out into space as Vincent hung on to his weapon for dear life. The cable snapped taut as he was yanked out into space, he was sure his hand had at the very least been sprained, but he held on for all he was worth. The stranger gripped his ankle more tightly, refusing to let the torrent break their connection.\nHe knew he had to act before the air rush was over, and there was only so much in the sector, so he made up his mind, let go of his bolt caster, causing him to spin around violently as the safety lanyard snapped taut, and reached for his holstered pistol. With precision born from years of practice, he drew the weapon and took aim at the hitch-hiker, squeezing off round after round into its head as they spun on the end of the line, but they refused to let go.\nThe magazine was emptied, the person\u0026rsquo;s face was now a mangled landscape of bloody craters and holes, but still they hung on. That was all he had left, he couldn\u0026rsquo;t reach his clips to reload his weapon and his bolt caster was occupied keeping him attached to the asteroid. He was exhausted, broken and the air was nearly gone from the sector by now.\nUnheard in the weakening torrent of air however, a final crate had broken loose of the deck and as they spun in space, the shipping container clipped the stranger bodily, tearing them from Vincent\u0026rsquo;s leg and launching them out into the cold vacuum.\n"

	"content": "The beam hit me like a lance, driving through my body and tearing up my insides. On the good side it seemed to be cauterizing the wound it created so there was little chance of me bleeding to death. God, how did I get involved in this mess? He came at me again, pointing his fingers at me like I used to do with my kid brother when I was young, index finger out, thumb up like the hammer of a pistol. Only this guy had a lot more punch behind the gesture than me shouting \u0026lsquo;bang\u0026rsquo;.\u0026nbsp; He grinned evilly as the tip of his finger began to glow bright yellow and I managed to roll to the side just as the lance of laser light bore through the wall I was leaning against.\nAll of this over a damn trinket. When the gal asked me to go after it I thought it would be nothing more than a milk run. How difficult could be to recover something like that? Sure it had some sentimental value, but that was it. There was no intrinsic value in the thing at all. It was just an angry ex-husband lashing out at his estranged wife. It hadn\u0026rsquo;t taken long to track him down to this old condemned warehouse. He left a trail of robberies and murders in his wake that the greenest of detectives could follow with little effort. Forcing my mind back to the here and now I pushed up off of the floor as another lance of light melted a barely discernable hole in the floor where my head had just been.\nNo way was I going down like this. Killed by some two-bit super in an old washed out warehouse in the slums of Union City. Focusing my mind I held my hands out in front of me in a fighting stance as I regained my feet. The bastard actually laughed at me then, the dark curls on his head bouncing happily created a stark contrast to thickly scarred skin criss-crossing his face. His one good eye was an acidy yellow color, the other useless orb was white with scar tissue. He laughed loudly, presumably at my having taken up a fighting stance. He thought he had me. He thought his little laser beams could cut me to ribbons at will. He had no idea who he was fucking with.\n\u0026ldquo;Laugh all you like. I am taking it home with me.\u0026rdquo; I commented seriously.\nHe laughed more, finally managing to choke out some words in arrogant reply. \u0026ldquo;You don\u0026rsquo;t stand a chance dick.\u0026rdquo;\nHe was right of course. I AM a dick. A Private Investigator that is, but of course it doesn\u0026rsquo;t sound nearly as glamorous when he says it like that. \u0026ldquo;Quit yer yammering and get on with it then freak-o.\u0026rdquo;\nHis lips twisted up into a cruel sneer at the word and his good eye actually glowed for a second before he started rapid-firing lances of light at me. Focusing my mind I blanked out the rest of the world so that I could see nothing but him and his laser beams. Time slowed down around me as I forced myself into an alternate state of perception.\nIt took tremendous energy to make it happen but I was able to move between the lances of light as I closed the distance between us. I don\u0026rsquo;t want to give the impression that it was easy or anything. The closest analogy I can offer is for you to try and imagine dodging a non-stop volley of arrows shot out of compound hunting bows. Sure it\u0026rsquo;s possible, but I would never recommend it as a recreational activity.\nWilling my body into maximum performance I dodged and wove my way through the assault, watching his face change in slow motion from one of gleeful, care-free, wholesale destruction of property, to consternation at not being able to hit his \u0026lsquo;helpless\u0026rsquo; target with volley after volley of white-hot death. Imagine his surprise when I closed the gap and let fly with an attack of my own. I cocked back my back hand and drove it with all the strength in my body, straight into his ugly, scarred nose. I felt the cartilage crack and break under the force of the blow, and suddenly time snapped back to normal like a rubber-band returning to true after being shot across a room.\nThe perp lay on the ground cradling his nose and wailing like a baby as blood filled up his cupped hands and spilled out onto the floor. I rolled him over onto his stomach roughly with my food and then drove my knee into his back as I kneeled on him. With no small amount of pleasure I hauled his hands back behind him and cuffed them behind his back with the reinforced cuffs I had just bought the day before. All these supers showing up in the city had finally forced me to start buying the expensive gear in order to get my job done. As I stood up and pushed his forehead into the floor roughly just to rough him up a bit more. Nice thing about being a PI was that I wasn\u0026rsquo;t as tightly bound by the niceties as the cops were.\nFinally I had a moment to take stock of my injuries. Looking down at my shirt I could barely see the half a dozen pinholes he had burned through it. Lifting it up and looking at my athletic stomach I was able to see a few small discolored spots where the beams had cut through me. It was uncomfortable at best, having a lance of laser light stab through your body like that. But in the end I would probably have to go see my doctor to see if anything had been really badly damaged internally.\nEnough of that for now. Dropping my shirt back into place I scanned around the room for my target. Finally I found it sitting on a messy table, covered with old fast food wrappers and other trash. I quickly moved across the room and snatched the thing from its resting place amid the refuse and stench. Looking at it for a moment it still struck me as odd that someone would steal it, let alone pay my exorbitant fee for its recovery. Still, they had hired the best and that is what they were going to get.\n\u0026ldquo;Time to get you home to mama.\u0026rdquo; I muttered to the thing as I turned around to collect my perp and head home. Imagine my surprise when I found myself face to face with him. His nose was swollen up like a balloon and his good eye watered like a hose left on in the yard after the kids are done playing with it. I was only startled for a moment, but I\u0026rsquo;m sure it showed on my face. He grinned like a kid with a new toy on Christmas morning.\n\u0026ldquo;You\u0026rsquo;re gonna die dick.\u0026rdquo; He snarled at me. And as crazy as it sounds, I believed him. But I couldn\u0026rsquo;t let on to that fact. Fight to the end. Never give up. Fight. Fight. Fight.\n\u0026ldquo;Don\u0026rsquo;t fuck with me freak-o. Get down or I\u0026rsquo;ll put you down again.\u0026rdquo; That\u0026rsquo;s it. Sound tough. Straight to the end. The sinking feeling in my stomach was making my vision blurry. \u0026ldquo;You can\u0026rsquo;t touch me with your hands restrained.\u0026rdquo; Something was wrong and I knew it.\n\u0026ldquo;Just cause I never used my powers with anything but my hands before don\u0026rsquo;t mean I can\u0026rsquo;t.\u0026rdquo; He sneered. \u0026ldquo;Always good to have a back-up plan.\u0026rdquo;\nAll of a sudden it was clear to me. In all the intel I had pulled on this guy it always said he had one useless, scarred eye. But none of it ever mentioned how it got that way. I looked on in horror as the scarred orb began to glow brightly, and I knew it was over. I couldn\u0026rsquo;t focus fast enough, much though I tried. This time, time slowed down in a much different manner than when I caused it. This time it was the slowed down time of a dying person who\u0026rsquo;s life was flashing before their eyes. A condemned man on their way to the chair after their last meal. The beam cut through my skull like a hot knife through butter. I saw him move the eye this way and that, carving up my brain like one might scramble an egg. It all happened so fast that there wasn\u0026rsquo;t even time to feel it going on. An instant later I was sightless and falling to the floor in a heap. My body stopped feeling and my mind closed up shop and shut down. All this over a damn teddy bear\u0026hellip;\n"

No. They never did say anything beyond it was all your fault.\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And you think the nanites were changing them from male to female?\u0026rdquo; She did her best to avoid the tender spot on his leg with her fingers. He groaned his enjoyment of her ministrations as she manipulated the pressure points in his lower legs.\n\u0026ldquo;Mmmm. Pretty sure, yeah. Damn that\u0026rsquo;s nice Ree\u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\n\u0026ldquo;And her hair and eyes were blue but otherwise she looked like me?\u0026rdquo; She dug her fingertips into the soles of his feet and twisted them around a couple of times, causing several of the joints in his feet to pop loudly.\n\u0026ldquo;Uhhhhhh\u0026hellip; Yeah. I\u0026rsquo;ve no idea how that happened, or if it means anything at all really. In any case, it isn\u0026rsquo;t as though we have to worry about it now. They were pushed out into space without protection.

It had been more than a year ago that it had happened\u0026hellip; There were no scars or other visible signs that it had ever even happened, but it had. She remembered it as if it were the day before, the sickening feeling as the mercenary Gregory Shantal had twisted her left hand right off of her body with a resounding snapping sound and a tearing of flesh. The hand that he had kept after wrenching it forcibly from her arm. The hand that was teeming with nanites. Nanites designed to rebuild her body out of any available materials\u0026hellip;\n"

Kalijor is a world of high fantasy where people\u0026rsquo;s avatars can choose to take on epic quests, craft invaluable relics, or just hang out at the local tavern with their friend from across the solar system.\nIn a digital world where electrons are king, information and currency exchanged in Kalijor actually moves from person to person in the real world. Kalijor is used as a place for business meetings, clandestine deals, and corporate subterfuge. But is there more to the world of Kalijor than meets the eye? Is the line between there and the real world as impenetrable as corporate leadership would have their citizens believe?\nOn this site you will find news and information about the world of Kalijor, and the books in which you can read about all of the people in it. So have a look around, see what you think. Read some sample chapters and check out the wiki where the author keeps track of all the characters, ships, places, equipment, and more. And if you feel so inclined, drop by the forums and say hello!\n"

This arrangement allows the weapon to have a longer barrel which increases accuracy while at the same time keeping the overall length of the weapon the same, or in some cases even shorter than the standard design.

Near the eastern edge of the same fissure lies the sister city of Hector . The two cities are now in the process of enclosing the vast expanse of trench between them, nearly eighteen hundred miles, and terra-forming the floor of the trench into a rain forest. Achilles is the manufacturing capitol of Mars. Most of the planet’s research and development happens here, funded by the solar system’s major corporations. The city is designed around a central shaft that sinks eight thousand feet into the Martian bedrock with residential and commercial facilities at the top of the shaft, closer to the dome that covers the shaft and permits sunlight to enter. The bottom half of the shaft is all manufacturing facilities, factories, and laboratories.\nAchilles is the primary manufacturing city on Mars. It is one of the great wonders of human engineering in the Sol system. The entire city is built around a single central shaft that is dug down more than eight-thousand feet into the surface of the planet. This shaft is capped off with a large dome to allow as much sunlight as possible into the city, but by the time it filters down to the bottom of the shaft there is not much left of it.\nAround the central shaft are two tracks that each support a high-speed mass-transit vehicle that quickly and efficiently moves people up and down the spiraling platform that rings the shaft.\nThe top level is where most of the housing is located, sprawling out around the central shaft on three sides like a mostly vertical suburbia. The fourth side of the shaft is where the spaceport is located.\nAs one gets deeper into the shaft, the light becomes much harsher, and more artificial. By the time one reaches the bottom, the sunlight is nothing more than a spot and all usable light is issued from artificial sources. The bottom of the shaft is littered with tons of garbage and discarded refuse from all of the higher levels of the city.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government Achilles is operated by a counsil of officers from all of the locally operating corporations. This counsil debates policy in an open forum to decide policy which is then ratified into action by majority vote by those in attendance. This body defers to the Conglomerate and can be overridden by their wishes, although this never happens publicly. Because of its importance as a manufacturing resource, the Conglomerate often guides Achilles governmental affairs with a not too subtle hand, ensuring that the city will be able to provide for the needs of the solar system.\nHistory Spoilers In \u0026lsquo;The First Key of Kalijor\u0026rsquo; a major scene takes place in Achilles, during which, Riana defeats the control collar that Xavier placed on her. She and Willhelmina then make a harrowing escape from the bowels of the city on a motorcycle while under fire from several flying vehicles. \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Achilles\npermalink: /Achilles/ "

Her naturally bright green eyes come from her father\u0026rsquo;s side of the family, and when she graduated high school, she purchased gene-therapy to change her hair color to match. Subsequent events have seen several additional changes made to her body, many of which were without her conscent, while she was under the mental control of Turin. Her ears are both pierced mutiple times, as are her left eyebrow, right nostril (exterior), and right lower lip.

After a mugging attempt on Alina and her friend, Daray, she was paralyzed from the waist down by a vibro-knife wound to the gut.

She led a group of adventurers for many years and was the best of friends with each and every one of them. Her zeal for life and adventure got the group into more trouble than was necessary but she wouldn\u0026rsquo;t have had it any other way.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Ambrai Valkyrie was an elf that grew up in Pandoria and the Forest of Brume. She took readily to the arts of the Ranger, against her parent’s wishes for her to follow the family path of the Druid. In order to be less in their view, she took to adventuring at a young age and learned most of her skills in the world at large, from anyone who would teach her.\nEventually she fell into the company of Ezrina Reyals, and Kilishandra Thorindal and their friends. Eventually, Ambrai developed feelings for a human martial artist that traveled with them regularly and was in the middle of professing her feelings for him in an inn room in Rathalon when Kilishandra broke down the door and confessed her own love for Ambrai. In the confusion that followed this event, Kilishandra started spending more time away from the group and Ambrai pursued her love of the warrior, Vargrus.\nShortly thereafter, Kilishandra was stabbed with a cursed dagger by her reincarnated first lover, Rhaeton, and started sliding down the path to her eventual death. When Ezrina also fell under the dagger and a solution was proposed requiring another, uncursed individual, Ambrai quickly volunteered to assist. During the ritual she was exposed to Kilishandra’s true, raw emotions, and understood how much she really did lover her. But she touched on something else in Kilishandra’s mind, and realizing that it was the seed of the curse, quickly absorbed it into her own mind and hid it away.\nAfter the ritual concluded and was declared a success, Ambrai went back to her life with Vargrus, harboring the secret of what she had done to save her friends. Over time, she and Vargrus bore children and as he grew old Ambrai realized that she would eventually be alone. She had second thoughts about her decision to refuse Kilishandra’s love, a love that would last for centuries or more, as they were both elf kind.\nAfter Vargrus died of old age, the seed of evil long locked away in her mind cracked open and began to grow, fed by Ambrai’s feelings of doubt and loneliness. Eventually the darkness inside her took hold of her mind and she turned down the path of darkness. She exhumed the body of Kilishandra and reanimated it using magic she had stolen from a lich she had slain.\nDivining the source of Ezrina’s ability to bear children and finding the amulet buried with Kilishandra’s body, Ambrai developed a plan to rekindle the love she felt she had denied herself all those years ago. She began slaying adventurers in order to recharge the amulet so that she might also bear a child of Kilishandra’s blood.\nSpoilers Status: Deceased\nCategory:People_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Ambrai Valkyrie\npermalink: /Ambrai_Valkyrie/ "

The disk is suspended within a magnetic field so that it can not touch any portion of its casing, and then spun at extreme velocities (Approximately 130,000 RPM). This creates a gravito-magnetic field that extends outward from the device in a 100 ft radius. For most small craft, one or two generators is usually enough to create approximately 1G (Earth normal) of gravitational force throughout the entire vessel.\nIt is important to note that the addition of artificial gravity to space-faring vessels, while an important step towards space exploration and colonization, was not the final answer needed to make it more plausible. There are several factors of space travel that must be considered for long-term exposure purposes, gravity being a significant one. Other factors include but are not limited to the following:\nRadiation/EM shielding (filtering out those energies present in space which are NOT present in a livable atmosphere)\nRadiation and EM field generation (reproducing those energies that ARE present in a livable atmosphere, and necessary for long-term health)\nAcceleration/decelaeraion/inertial compensation (in order to keep the human body from turning to paste during sudden maneuvers and alterations in ship velocities)\nThese gravity generating devices can also be used in fixed/planetary applications in order to increase whatever gravity they have to 1G. In this application they are usually known as \u0026ldquo;Gravity Levelers\u0026rdquo; since they are not creating the entire gravity field by themselves, but rather adding to an existing field in order to increase its strength. At present there is no known way of reducing a gravity field in order to make high gravity installations more palatable to the human body.\nThere is research into other means of creating gravity artificially, using the same principals as the Gravitic super-luminal drive systems, however, creating a field that is dispersed widely enough and consistently enough for practical purposes is proving to be troublesome at present.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Artificial Gravity\npermalink: /Artificial_Gravity/ "

Exports: The Belt is the Sol system’s primary source of raw metals and other hard construction materials.\nDescription ‘The Belt’ refers to the community that lives and works in the asteroid belt that lay between Jupiter and Saturn. As such, it is not really a physical location, so much as a a series of cobbled-together space stations/habitats amongst the asteroids. Usually, but not always, there is a path cleared to the facility so that large ships can get in and out to halul in supplies and haul out mined materials.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government This is not a large, cohesive community like most of the other planets maintain, but rather a great number of tiny stations and bases that all operate independently of one another. Each station is run by a family with the head of household typically calling the shots within their particular operation. Each month the Conglomerate sets a quota for ‘The Belt’ to meet and then the heads of households meet to divvy up the work load in order to maximize resources and profits. Occasionally there is a small skirmish between households but usually they are too interested in meeting quota to be dealing with petty squabbles. ‘The Belt’ is easily the best place for anyone who is trying to avoid detection to secret themselves away. Most of the families will harbor refugees for a price and the decentralized nature of the community makes it neigh impossible to locate anyone not wishing to be found.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Asteroid Belt\npermalink: /Asteroid_Belt/ "

The city is nestled into three tiers that are composed of the tightly intertwined branches of a miles high petrified tree on the southern apex of the Uraval Mountains . The tiers of the city each represent a class of people, with the lowest tier being home to the lower class laborers, shops, artisans and so forth. All food stuffs are grown/raised on the first tier as well, crops consist of a light, airy grain that only grows in Avian and makes breads and pastries of such fine, light flavor that they are exported to the rest of Kalijor and place even the lowest class citizens of Avian in extremely comfortable living standards. The second tier is home to all of the aristocrats and government offices of the city and the third tier is host to only the palace and royal family.\nAvian can be reached by a few methods, the most daunting of which would be to climb up the spiraling, petrified branches that wind their way up the tree from ground level. Most dedicated travelers can make the ascent in about three days if they are not in a tremendous rush. For a small fee the citizens of Avian will ferry travelers and their things up to the lower tier of the city on the backs of tamed griffons. This is much faster than climbing but some people do not enjoy the experience of being miles above the ground on the back of a griffon. The easiest way by far to enter Avian is to simply take the portal from Rathalon, or use a portal ring. This will put travelers in the portal chamber on the bottom tier of the city and is usually the best means of arrival and departure available.\nFeatures/Places of Note Avian is built in three tiers that sit atop a mile-high, petrified tree on the southern horn of the Uraval Mountains. The tiers of the city are built on top of progressively higher layers of woven-together branches. The lowest tier of Avian is where all of the crops are grown, the livestock is kept, the merchants have their shops and the portal chamber is located.\nThe second tier is where most of the aristocracy make their homes. There is a large school located here that most of the wealthy families of Kalijor send their children to for higher education.\nThe top tier of the city is the location of the royal palace and the militia.\nNotable locations in Avian are the university and the palace, as well as the \\\u0026lsquo;fields\\\u0026rsquo; where they use a form of hydroponics to grow their food, most of which is used to create light and airy foods that are much coveted by the rest of Kalijor.\nGovernment in Avian is a monarchy that changes regularly through marriages and the mingling of bloodlines that is enforced by the constitution of the city which requires the current ruler of the city to take a life-mate from among the people rather than the aristocracy or other royal bloodlines.\nThe Avian fighting forces are well equipped by the best craftsman in Talanor and, although a small force, they are very much a force to be reckoned with.\nGovernment Government in Avian is a monarchy system where the king/queen presides over a parliament and together they arrive at policy decisions and make the city work, however it is a true monarchy in that if the king/queen chooses to do so, they can overrule anything the parliament says and simply decide on policy themselves, although this rarely, if ever happens.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Avian\npermalink: /Avian/ "

	"content": " title: Body Armor desc:\ndate: 2019/01/25 version: 1.0.0 template:\nnav: Body_Armor percent: 100 authors:\nPersonal protective body armor comes in a variety of shapes, styles and materials, most of which are designed for specific conditions, or to protect against specific forms of damage. For the purposes of simplicity, the records here are broken down into categories describing the physical composition or properties of the armor type in question, such as soft, or hard, etc.\nSoft Armor is usually composed of some type of synthetic material that is woven in numerous layers that are designed to spread out the kinetic force of incoming projectiles, thereby reducing the amount of penetrative force or damage said projectile is capable of inflicting. Weapons with cutting edges are typically more effective against soft armors as they tend to cut and sever the carefully woven fibers rather than impacting with blunt force. Materials such as Kevlar, carbon fiber, and certain spider silks have all been used very effectively in soft armors for hundreds of years and are still in use now, along with several newer, stronger and more flexible (and accordingly more expensive) materials. Soft armor will protect against most Class B weapon fire and many class A weapons (Except the sharp and pointy ones), provided the assailant is not using some form of armor piercing munitions. Some light Class C weapons will do greatly reduced damage to a person wearing soft armor, but for the most part anyone facing Class C or greater weapons in soft armor had better consider a good escape plan. With rare exception, no soft armor is likely to provide even the barest of defense against energy weapons or explosives. Soft armors are by far the most cost effective and easiest to obtain.\nHard Armor is usually composed of some form of rigid, malleable material that is capable of stopping most small projectiles and some light energy weapons cold. The plates are usually custom made to a specific user in order to match their joint structure and mobility as closely as possible and anyone wearing hard armor designed for someone else is likely to have a very difficult time of it if they can manage at all. There are some movement penalties associated with hard armors as joints and flexibility are restricted in favor of a higher degree of protection. Hard armors are extremely effective against all Class A and Class B weapons, and will shrug off most Class C weapon damage as well. It will dissipate the damage from most light explosives, hand grenades and such, and can even offer other benefits such as environmental seals, allowing the user to traverse open vacuum, harsh climates and inhospitable planets, as well as negating the effectiveness of most chemical agents that may be dispersed through the air. Hard armors are considerably more expensive than soft armors (especially if they are environmental as well), and their availability is not wide spread, although if one has the funds, it could be located without too much trouble.\nReactive Armor is the best of two worlds. Reactive armor is constructed using a combination of hard and soft materials, with the addition of some practical science thrown in for good measure. The basic idea is that the armor is able to sense when damage is occurring at a particular point, and is then able to react to that damage by somehow increasing the level of protection at that specific point. For example, there could be a layer of magnetically reactive liquid suspended between the lining and outer layer of the armor that, when the suit senses danger, it applies an electromagnetic field to the area in danger, thus causing the liquid to solidify, creating a piece of hard armor at the point of trauma only and keeping the rest of the suit flexible enough to allow its wearer to bend and move out of harms way, further reducing the damage. Many forms of reactive armor have been developed and experimented with over the years and the technologies are wildly different from one design to another, but the basic principal is the same. The armor senses danger or potential damage and reacts by increasing the level of protection in that spot. In addition to all of this, reactive armors can be made in any size, shape, color, weight and level of protection desired by an individual, and can include features such as built in computers (they are there already to run the reactive portion of the armor so why not add more to do other things with? Like targeting, Identify Friend or Foe [IFF], night vision, etc), or environmental seals and so on. Reactive armors are capable of providing extreme protection against all Class A, B, and C weapons and explosives including to some degree many energy weapons. The down side to this however is that typically this armor can only be ‘used’ one time. Once it is subjected to damage, it weakens the system as a whole and it must be either meticulously repaired or, more often than not, scrapped and replaced entirely. Reactive armors are prohibitively expensive and are available only to the military, government, and certain extremely powerful mega-corporations.\nPower Armors are in a class all their own. These armor systems are almost vehicles in their capabilities and complexity, but are included here because their size and function limits them specifically to single person use in the fields of infantry and espionage. Power armor is usually some combination of Hard and Reactive armors with the added benefit of structural reinforcement and motor assisted movement. These motor and structural enhancements allow the wearer of power armor to be stronger, faster, and more agile than any normal person would otherwise be capable of. Through the use of micro turbines and ducted fan/compressed air systems flight or hovering is even possible. The other nice benefit of the structural and strength enhancements is that much heavier weapons can be used by the wearer of the power armor and in fact, many power armor systems include an array of built-in weapon systems and sensors that would otherwise be reserved for vehicle mounting. All power armor systems are environmentally sealed and provide protection against nearly all Class A, B, C, and D weapons and explosives, including energy weapons and have even been known to fight toe-to-toe against class E weapon systems and fare reasonably well. The wearer of a good suit of power armor is essentially enclosed within a compact, extremely mobile tank. These suites are expensive in the extreme and due to the weapon systems that are usually outfitted on them, they are closely controlled by the military, restricting their use to primarily military personnel, and a few other extremely well connected and financed corporations.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Body Armor\npermalink: /Body_Armor/ "

There is no water in the Burning Expanse save for a small oasis that is surrounded by high, impassable cliffs in the southeastern corner of the area. There are no roads here, no cities, no homes, and definitely no guards or patrols. The area is littered with giant scorpions, giants, snakes and other predators that have adapted well to the harsh conditions. The Burning Expanse is rumored to be the resting place of another of the five ziggurats of Kalijor where the ancient Obscuri artifacts are hidden away from the world. In the center of the Burning Expanse is a large fissure that drops away seemingly into nothingness below and it is within this fissure that there is a long-buried dungeon that adventurers frequent in search of treasures of all kinds. The dungeon is the ancient home of a powerful mage-turned-lich and is crawling with powerful undead of all kinds.\nThe Burning Expanse is a huge area of desert that lay south of the Southern Plain of Serenity and stretches to the south edge of Kalijor. On the western edge it butts up against the Endless Ocean and stretched far to the east until it runs into the southern tail of the Uraval Mountains.\nFeatures/Places of Note The burning Expanse has only two remarkable features. The first is an oasis, surrounded by high cliff walls in the bottom central area of the region, the other is a deep fissure in the sands a bit northwest of the oasis. The fissure is the entry point to several deep caverns beneath the surface where adventurers seem to favor looking for treasure.\nThis region is populated by tribes of creatures that have insect-like lower bodies and somewhat human upper bodies. They are a war-like race that tends to prey upon travelers, then use the equipment they scavenge from them to wage war against their own rival tribes.\nThere are also numerous desert species living here, mostly snakes, insects and smaller animals, a few birds of prey and the occasional larger predatory animals.\nThe average temperature in the Burning Expanse is in excess of 40 degrees Celsius with almost no measurable precipitation.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Burning Expanse\npermalink: /Burning_Expanse/ "

One of the other reason for its size is that it is one of the only cities on Kalijor where no one cares who you are or where you came from to get there. Rathalon may make claims to the contrary about their own policies, but rest assured that if you try to extort people there, or just happen to be a vampire, you will find yourself suddenly unwelcome.\nBête Noire is also a hub for all manner of travelers and adventurers that are on their way to somewhere. There are many still, as yet, unfound treasure troves and artifacts from before the Great War to be found on the dark side of Kalijor and those seeking these things need a place to stop, resupply, and recharge their batteries from time to time.\nThe city of Bête Noire is NOT part of the Kalijor portal network and thus, the only way for the average traveler to get there is to travel by foot. Surrounding the city and volcano of Bête Noire is the immense and inhospitable Plain of Sorrow which is plagued by all manner of undead and other monsters that will impede any road-weary travelers moving between Bête Noire and the Lich King\u0026rsquo;s Gate that leads back to the light side of Kalijor.\nFeatures/Places of Note The architecture in Bête Noire is as strange and varied as its inhabitants, ranging from simple mud and thatch structures to elaborate, multi-story buildings constructed of the finest imported stones and glass.\nWithin the always-open gates of Bête Noire an adventurer can find anything they may be looking for, from arms and armor, to livestock, and from hired muscle to hired companionship.\nGovernment There is no government in Bête Noire per se, rather it is overseen by a loose conglomeration of the merchants and profiteers that stand to gain, or loose, the most in the city’s day to day operations. This loose conglomeration takes regular meetings that move around, each member playing host in their own shop/facility at some point, and they hold authority over a form of ‘brute squad’ composed of local thugs and hit men, that is used to carry out any of their less popular mandates.\nOne must always watch one\u0026rsquo;s back while inside, and near, the city limits however, as there is little in the way of law enforcement and less in the way of government here. Matters of state are decided upon by a once-monthly meeting of business owners and \u0026lsquo;protection\u0026rsquo; is offered by a gang of hired thus that are more or less left to their own designs as to how the \u0026lsquo;law\u0026rsquo; should best be enforced.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Bête Noire\npermalink: /Bête_Noire/ "

Legislative/operational policy is decided by public assembly and debate that is presided over by a minimum of 99 heads of family.\nMost policy is debated and decided upon by the council of family heads and once a decision is made and agreed upon, it is posted publically and can be stopped before it is officially inacted if 50%+1 of registered voters disagree with the resolution.\nSimilarly, any registered voter may bring a resolution before the assembly, make a case for it in teh public forum/debate, and have it posted as a proposed policy, at which point it is voted upon by all registered voters, including the heads of household that make up the current counsil of family heads. If such a resolution should receive 50%+1 positive votes from the registered voter base, then it is ratified into action.\nAny resolutions can be repealed/removed from operation by similar means.

The only land based approach to Cohai is from a narrow pass in the Forest of Brume that leads to an ancient rope bridge spanning the two-hundred foot gap from the mountains to the spire. The Cohai Observatory was carved by hand from the tip of the spire, and is surrounded by a high wall with only one gate in it. Inside the high wall is a bit of a paradox, a lush, almost tropical garden fills the considerable space between the outer wall and the actual keep. The garden is filled with well manicured grass, trees, flowers, and other plant and animal life that is all constantly attended to by the occupants of the observatory. The keep itself is a utilitarian structure, with no luxuries to speak of aside from warm baths that are filled from a hot water mineral spring somewhere far below the observatory. In the distant past, it is said that Cohai was used to keep watch over the forest of Brume and surrounding land so that warning might be sent off if armies were seen moving or massing below, but now it is used as a place of self discovery and meditation where people are welcomed and allowed to stay for as long as they want in the pursuit of self realization. Cohai is loosely governed by the troll Gornin and its doors are open to all who are willing to perform work and chores that keep the observatory running while they continue their studies.\nThe Cohai Observatory is more of an outpost than an actual city, however it is a node on the Kalijor portal network and as such it bears mentioning as a population city.\nFeatures/Places of Note The observatory sits atop a spire of rock that juts out from a high, sheer cliff on the western face of the Uraval Mountains. The only physical access to the observatory is via a narrow gap in the cliff wall in the Forest of Brume, barely wide enough for a single person to squeeze through. Once through the gap, you must make your way through a narrow valley that is filled with twisted, interwoven trees and shrubs. As you move deeper into the ravine, you head up a sharp incline and eventually it widens as you move higher into the mountains. Eventually it becomes wide enough that the trees no longer have to be threaded through in order to gain passage. At the top of the pass, after you move above the tree line you turn around a sharp bend and come face to face with wide open space. From here you can see the entire Forest of Brume, the Great Inland Sea and even the edges of the Endless Ocean. In the center of the view, sitting atop a massive column of rock is a large, walled keep that is connected to the top of the pass by a rickety rope bridge.\nEntrance into the observatory is gained by ringing the bell next to the massive gate in an alcove in the surrounding wall and then waiting until someone answers the call, which can take upwards of a week in some cases. Even those arriving by portal will appear in a small chamber that is locked from the inside and has a similar bell set up next to it.\nOnce inside the wall of the keep most people are taken by surprise. The courtyard is filled with well-manicured flower gardens, trees, and rock gardens. Many sentients move about the grounds taking care of things, meditating, debating, and practicing magic or martial arts.\nInside the keep is a simple, utilitarian environment that is nothing more than what is necessary to keep its occupants clean, out of the weather, and well fed. Beneath the keep, well below the level of the forest floor far below, is a giant reservoir with a massive column of water rising out of it. This column pushes its way up into the bottom of the observatory. This magic spring is where Cohai gets all of its fresh water and the caverns around the reservoir lead into the depths of the Uraval Mountains and, eventually, to a myriad of other places in Kalijor.\nThe shepherd of the Observatory is a troll by the name of Gornin who is said to have been there for centuries, and whose council, although cryptic at best, is highly regarded among all sentients of power throughout Kalijor.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Cohai Observatory\npermalink: /Cohai_Observatory/ "

Sub-space is mathematically defined as an infinite space that exists within our realm inside a finite boundary. It was discovered in the past 300 years that in any given sub-space realm there is a direct correlation between each point in that realm and each point within our own. However, energy behaves differently within any given sub-space realm than it does within normal-space. As an example, radio waves travel at extremely high relativistic speeds within certain sub-space realms, allowing the injection of a radio wave at one point in normal-space where it will cross sub-space at extreme super-luminal speeds (on the order of 10^21c) where the receiving unit will then pull the signal back out of sub-space again. This method allows for nearly instantaneous, extremely low latency communications across nearly limitless spans of real-space.\nSub-space communications technology is still relatively large physically, with transceivers requiring around six cubic feet of space and large power supplies.\nMost normal, short distance communications (short distance being under 1,000 miles or so) are still done using digitally encoded, secure radio frequency communications. Normal-space communicators use a variety of frequencies from 25MHz all the way up to 10GHz and an even broader array of digital compression/encryption. Most high quality communicators are capable of using any and all combinations of frequency and compression/encryption but some of the less expensive gear is limited in this regard, however it is not usually a concern as all you need is two similar devices to set up a line of communication. In terms of physical size, standard RF transceivers can be as small as a peanut (including the power supply, the actual transceiver is extremely small at about 1\u0026frasl;10 that size).\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Communications\npermalink: /Communications/ "

After the industry maxed out the capabilities of standard semi-conductor chips they moved on to super-conducting materials and then to the inevitable optical systems, allowing computers to operate at relativistic speeds. Today\u0026rsquo;s computers are all optical processing units that operate on a hexadecimal base programming system. Moving away from a binary base language allows developers to represent significantly more complicated concepts and data with much smaller amounts of information. This combined with relativistic processing speeds insures that, in most cases, there is little chance of a computer not having enough processing muscle to support even the most complicated tasks/software with ease.\nMemory systems are all optical as well, using three-dimensional, holographic storage mediums for near instant access to massive amounts of information. At last the computer\u0026rsquo;s memory and storage devices are integrated into one single space and technology which allows for instant on systems and complete resistance to power loss and most catastrophic data loss scenarios.\nThe main boards and other peripherals have been replaced with an ODN or Optical Data Network backbone architecture that allows, again, for relativistic throughput of information from the CPU to anywhere else attached to the computer.\nActual CPU processing speeds are measured in PetaFlops for most normal consumer computers and there is no significant difference between the wrist mounted mobile computers and the most powerful of fixed, home systems.\nComputer display technology has evolved to the point at which there is no actual fixed display, rather, there is a holographic display that floats somewhere near the interface point, which can be either fixed or also holographic in nature depending on the situation and the user\u0026rsquo;s needs/desires.\nMost modern computers can output to an infinite number of holographic displays simultaneously, however most normal users limit themselves to between one and four \u0026lsquo;displays\u0026rsquo; in order to keep themselves productive. The \u0026lsquo;display\u0026rsquo; can be nearly any size, even on a small wrist type computer, although power consumption increases substantially once the display increases beyond about 10 cubic feet.\nInterface technology as also advanced significantly, now falling into one of two common forms. Hard interfaces are touch sensitive, user configurable surfaces that can change and be changed per application or per user on that particular terminal.\nSoft interfaces are three dimensional projections that track the movements of the user within their area and interpret that movement as input. This can as simple as a virtual keyboard or as complex as allowing the user to reach into the display area, \u0026lsquo;grab\u0026rsquo; a portion or element of the display and then move it elsewhere. These displays are by far the most common on most mobile computers as they allow said devices to be considerably smaller in size.\nStorage technology has become extravagantly large over the years, with an average size data wafer or crystal able to contain PetaBytes of information in even their smallest sizes.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Computers\npermalink: /Computers/ "

In the beginning of the 20th century it began with pace-makers and artificial hearts and from there developed at a break-neck pace until before long any organ in the human body, with the exception of the spine and brain, could be easily replaced with an artificial equivalent. Once joints, bones, and even muscle tissue began to be effectively replaced and the ties into the nervous system became more reliable and faster, it did not take a fantastic leap of creativity to begin using this science to actually augment the parts in question.\nOver the course of a thousand years the science began to build people that were 5, 10, even 50 and 100 times stronger than a normal person. People would actually replace their entire bodies with artificial parts, effectively transforming themselves into machines of war with internal, sometimes concealed weapons systems powered by on board nuclear fusion power plants to keep them running indefinitely.\nModern cybernetics are still used for organ and tissue replacement for medical purposes. Any augmentation of the body is highly illegal unless it is for military purposes on enlisted soldiers who, when their term of service is up, will have their upgrades removed and replaced with standard medical-grade cybernetics.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Cybernetics\npermalink: /Cybernetics/ "

She has a look about her that is at once very pleasing to the eye and at the same time engineered to fade quickly from memory. She wears her hair in a short style that hangs straight down from her head like a curtain covering her ears. It is short in the back (barely covering much below the base of her skull) and long in the front (hanging down to below her shoulders). Her dark, cobalt eyes are the only thing about her that tends to stick in people’s memories despite her obvious attractiveness. She always wears a skin-tight, rubbery catsuit that covers her from her neck down, even sealing in her fingers and toes. This ‘Skinsuit’ is able to morph and mould itself into a variety of shapes, colors, and densities, allowing her to simulate any sort of clothing up to and including battle armor and even a sealed space suit when necessary, however it will ALWAYS have a rubbery look, feel, and shine to it no matter what shape or color it takes on.\nGeneral Description Daray, or ‘Dare’ as she likes to be called, is the result of an extreme amount of genetic and cybernetic re-engineering. Formerly a man known as Darren Erricson, Daray was born when one of Darren\u0026rsquo;s jobs went bad and he ended up covered in someone\u0026rsquo;s genetic engineering experiment. Working a deal with Solidarity Online to save himself, they provided him with facilities and support to see the experiment through to completion, since it had gone too far to be stopped or reversed. Daray helped uncover and stop a plot against Solidarity Online\u0026rsquo;s Kalijor MMO and has since become a free agent, carrying on with the espionage game using her new physiology and skills to some great effect. Dare has been genetically enhanced in so many ways that she really isn\u0026rsquo;t even human any more, with reinforced bones, increased muscle density, highly enhanced senses, reflexes, and speed. Her strangest talents are the ability to regenerate from almost any wound, including lost/severed limbs, and even a bullet wound to the head. She is also able to project a limited number of bio-plasma blasts from a series of glands concealed under the skin of her forearms. The last major modification to her body has been the addition of a super computer that has been squeezed into her skull and is home to an extremely advanced Artificial Intelligence called APRIL.\nSkills of Note As a long-time Pincher, Daray has developed considerable talent in the areas of clandestine movement/sneaking, defeating locks both electrical and mechanical, and hacking computer systems. She is an accomplished Traceur (practitioner of Parkour/Free-Running) and a Class 3 hand to hand combatant (with leanings toward Class 2) in the rather flamboyant art of Capoeria.\nWith the assistance of Solidarity Online Daray has learned more about cloak and dagger activities than she ever wanted but is able to now recognize and lose a tail with efficiency as well as having an ability to properly tail someone with minimum chance of detection. She can operate most general vehicles and is able to passably pilot small spacecraft (although she is by no means rated to handle emergency maneuvers or combat flying) and can operate most forms of communication equipment.\nWith her background growing up with two super-star Digerati and APRIL\u0026rsquo;s assistance, Daray is a more than accomplished computer hacker, able to circumvent most security measures and enter all but the most well protected networks and systems with relative ease. Her ability to operate independently from, or in conjunction with APRIL while hacking means that they can focus their efforts to defeat security twice as quickly, or attack a problem from different angles simultaneously, putting more pressure on system defenses/protectors.\nDealing with unscrupulous people and corporate officials for most of her life, Daray is also a fairly shrewd, if abrupt, negotiator with a fair understanding of corporate politics and sociological structures. While she generally wants nothing to do with such things, she is able to understand them and often uses them the gain the upper hand in negotiations, or for leverage.\nDaray\u0026rsquo;s sarcastic wit, while not technically a skill, is a tool that she uses, mostly subconsciously, to both keep others at arm\u0026rsquo;s length and off balance. She\u0026rsquo;s found that making sure nobody can predict or expect what she will do next means that she can get away with much and remain secluded from the world and the dangers she perceives in deep personal connections.\nEquipment of Note Daray\u0026rsquo;s normal compliment of gear includes a good, high-quality ODN patch cable, a set of high-quality mechanical lock picks, and her trusty bastón.\nHer bastón are a set of alloy sticks, approximately 24 inches in length and about an inch in diameter that she carries in a sheath, slung across her back. She uses them as both offensive and defensive weapons, as pry bars, door shims, and whatever else she may need. As simple metal sticks, they do not cause her much trouble at Conglomerate checkpoints or customs kiosks and she is able to take them almost everywhere with her as they are perceived by others as being less dangerous than a standard sidearm, which is legal to carry. One end of each of her bastón is able to be unscrewed from the shaft to reveal a tiny hollow inside where she keeps three platinum slips, making for a total of six slips worth approximately 12,000 Conglomerate credits. Her emergency fund, should she ever need money and not have access to her credit accounts or other physical currency.\nAt her home in Tranquility, Daray has an arsenal the likes of which Ares has never conceived, consisting of ballistic and energy weapons, explosives, ammunition, armor, tactical gear, sensory equipment for surveillance and tracking and much more. It was all provided by Solidarity Online and was never removed when possession of the apartment was transferred to her, although she rarely uses any of it, preferring to rely instead on her skills, abilities, natural talents, and the simplest tools possible.\nHistory Spoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Future\u0026mdash; title: Daray (Dare) Bowen\npermalink: /Daray_(Dare)_Bowen/ "

Daray was given use of the home and its facilities when Xavier sent her to Tranquility to get to the bottom of the Aegis Online plan to kill or lobotomize millions of Kalijor players. After the mission was completed and debts were being settled, Xavier signed the deed to the penthouse over to Daray as an apology for the Skinsuit being permanently bonded to her body, preventing her from being returned to her original form through any known genetic engineering.\nThe penthouse is on the 32nd floor of a residential building less than ten minute\u0026rsquo;s walk from the Tranquility spaceport and is worth an estimated fifty million credits.\nFeatures/Places of Note Facilities include a commercial kitchen, a game room, a top of the line theater room, three bedrooms, a library, and office space, living room with wet bar, three bathrooms and a sunken/pit couch with a holographic display built into the central table, allowing for board games, videos, fire places, and even computer input/output to take place there.\nSpecial amenities, not known to anyone but Daray, Lana, and other agents of Solidarity Online include a top of the line quantum computer cluster with direct access to a dedicated sub-space transceiver, VPN tunnel to Solidarity Online data warehouses, and enough processing power to run both APRIL and SEAN\u0026rsquo;s programs with muscle to spare. Several armories, and hidden equipment lockers that are kept loaded for bear and able to supply equipment for nearly any field operation, and diagnostic laboratory equipment of the highest caliber.\nDaray and Lana now make their home here, with frequent trips to see Lana\u0026rsquo;s father and time away for business, but the house is kept clean and monitored by the full-time, around the clock building staff who have been hand-picked and security screened, and draw their salaries from Solidarity Online.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status:  Category:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Daray\u0026rsquo;s Penthouse\npermalink: /Daray\u0026rsquo;s_Penthouse/ "

Destra was forged in a magical fire by a dwarven smith and quenched in the blood of innocents killed by ritual sacrifice. The sword is coal black from tip to handle, it\u0026rsquo;s only mark of color being a deep, navy blue sapphire set into the pommel of the weapon. It is capable of repelling a large variety of magical attacks and even magically assists its wielder in blocking said attacks, however it does not do well against magics that hold or bind the wielder physically. Destra has a keen edge that is capable of damaging most materials without too much effort, although it is not likely to just cleave mundane weapons into pieces if they are of high quality, it will however damage their edges quite readily. The weapon\u0026rsquo;s hidden talent is its ability to create portals to anywhere in Kalijor that the wielder has physically been before, allowing them almost instant access to a myriad of locations that might otherwise take weeks to reach through conventional means. This ability even allows its wielder to be transported directly into oubliettes (areas that are technically outside of Kalijor, like pocket dimensions), again, if the wielder has physically been to those locations before.\nCategory:Weapons_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Destra\npermalink: /Destra/ "

Mostly luxury items and goods that are not produced locally. Exports: Officially, Nothing. Unofficially, the Dregs is the largest producer of starship components, sensory systems, drives, and habitate modules/components in the solar system.\nDescription The term ‘The Dregs’ does not refer to any place in particular but rather everything not covered specifically elsewhere. This term has been applied to anyone who lives outside ‘the system’ or ‘off the grid’. These are people who for one reason or another have chosen to disengage themselves from the conglomerate and its way of thinking. Dregs are usually looked down upon and openly despised by even the lowest class citizens of the Conglomerate. They tend to live off scraps and steal for what they need to survive. They live in sewage systems, recycling plants and other undesirable locations throughout the system, including some salvaged micro-space stations that they have taken possession of and hauled off into the uninhabited corners of the Sol system and brought back to life for occupation.\nThe Dregs are an assemblage of asteroids within the Sol system\u0026rsquo;s asteroid belt that have been hollowed out and connected together to form a rather unique population center. Each asteroid is its own, self-contained environment that is linked to those around it through a series of tunnels and tubes that allow easy movement from habitat to habitat. However, each of these habitats can be isolated from the others instantly if anything happens that would otherwise jeopardize the integrity of the network.\nThe people that live in The Dregs do so because they choose to live \u0026lsquo;off the grid\u0026rsquo; and away from the corporate landscape of the rest of humanity. The Dregs are nearly self-sufficient, requiring only minimal food-stuffs to be imported. By mining the surrounding asteroids, the inhabitants of The Dregs are able to produce metals, machines and equipment, and even drinkable water, oxygen to breathe and hydrogen to fuel their ship\u0026rsquo;s drive systems. They are even able to export certain products, such as drive systems and super-dense hull plating that cannot be made as cheaply anywhere else in the system due to labor laws and the constraints of forming the material\u0026rsquo;s matrices in gravity fields.\nOne of the largest buyers for such components is the conglomerate, although they would never publicly admit to it. All transactions are handled by third parties and usually take the form of commodity exchanges since the people of The Dregs do not use standard credits, or give them any value at all.\nMost of the people that live in The Dregs do so by choice, and even though their lives are difficult, they earn their living through hard work and toil, but live happily and feel fulfillment at the end of the day.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government Legislative/operational policy is decided by public assembly and debate that is presided over by a minimum of 99 heads of family.\nMost policy is debated and decided upon by the council of family heads and once a decision is made and agreed upon, it is posted publically and can be stopped before it is officially inacted if 50%+1 of registered voters disagree with the resolution.\nSimilarly, any registered voter may bring a resolution before the assembly, make a case for it in teh public forum/debate, and have it posted as a proposed policy, at which point it is voted upon by all registered voters, including the heads of household that make up the current counsil of family heads. If such a resolution should receive 50%+1 positive votes from the registered voter base, then it is ratified into action.\nAny resolutions can be repealed/removed from operation by similar means. Someone must publicly speak out at the forum to ask for its removal, at which point it is voted upon just like any act that is working to be made official.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Dregs\npermalink: /Dregs/ "

The blue-green gem in the night sky of every other world or station in the Sol system. Over five-hundred years ago the human race made a valiant attempt at destroying itself with the aid of nuclear fission and nuclear fusion weapons. They very nearly succeeded in this endeavor, only surviving because there were a few million people off-world when the war broke out.\nMuch has changed since that day, so long ago, but the scar of their heinous act still burns in the veins of every person that casts their eyes toward their once and former home, for no human being has set foot on the planet Earth since then as the radiation levels would instantly kill anyone who attempted to breathe its air.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government None\nHistory The cradel of human life and civilization, the Earth was utterly destroyed by a nuclear hollocaust when her offspring got into a quarral about how they should govern themselves. Since that day, nearly 600 years ago, the plane has been a barren wasteland, incapable of supporting life.\nSpoilers Imports: Everything. The Earth produces nothing at all despite its rejuvenated ecology.\nExports: Nothing. Nothing is produced on the Earth.\nPopulation: Unknown.\nDescription: The Earth has had nearly five-hundred years to recover from its near annihilation. In that time, and with some outside assistance by certain parties, it has flourished; returning to a state of nearly untouched beauty. The Conglomerate has gone to great pains to conceal this fact from anyone else however, still publicly claiming that the planet is highly irradiated and unlivable across the entirety of its surface. No ships are allowed to descend to Earth’s surface under any circumstances and any that try are destroyed without question by a strategic defense system in the Earth-Ring space station. The only way to get to the surface is by using one of the two secret orbital elevators in the Earth-ring station. One of the elevators touches down on a platform in the Gulf of Mexico, the other near Taiwan, and both are secured facilities that are guarded twenty four hours a day by well armed military units that kill on sight anyone without clearance.\n\nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Earth\npermalink: /Earth/ "

At each intersection of these tubes is a massive node where megacities have been built, each capable of housing hundreds of millions of people.\nThe megacities are each self-sufficient with the exception of food production. While they grow impressive amounts of food themselves in hydroponic gardens, it is not nearly enough for them to support their entire populations. As such the primary import of the Earth Ring Station is food.\nPower is generated through a combination of fusion generators, photovoltaic cells on the surface of the station, and a unique fluid system that generates power by circulating fluid throughout the rings of the station by the heating/cooling convection action of the sun on the surface of the station.\nThe rings of the station are used for the dual purpose of docking ships, both large and small, and fabrication/industrial activity, as well as additional housing, mostly for transients although many permanent residents choose to live in the rings as well since that allows them to stay closer to their work.\nThe normal, permanent population of the Earth Ring Station is in the neighborhood of five billion, making it by far the most populace center for human habitation in known space.\nEach of the megacity nodes is equipped with everything anyone could want including housing, schools, recreation, shopping, public parks, and anything else a person might need. An additional, long-unused feature of each of these cities are the six orbital elevator shafts that were once, more than five-hundred years ago, used to efficiently move large and small payloads from the surface of the Earth to the ring station.

He became widely known for creating entirely custom genes from scratch, at the young age of eighteen. From that point on, his destiny was sealed. His family all live and work within the structure of T.R.I.P., and their loyalty is without peer. So when Emil told them that he would not develop combat-oriented genes to create super soldiers for them, his life became a constant storm of pressure from all sides.\nHe designed custom genes for people to pay the bills for his private lab, and even designed Daray\u0026rsquo;s body for Solidarity Online, and remained on site to supervise her reconstruction. Much later in his life, he fell in love with a working girl, and agreed to pay her as a constant, personal companion in order to keep their love from the prying eyes of his family. The confluence of two separate events resulted in Emil\u0026rsquo;s need to escape T.R.I.P. and his family.\nFirst, his tireless efforts in the lab succeeded in creating a gene that allowed an organism to temporarially absorb genetic characteristics of others, by touch. He hid this success by incorporating it in a recessive nook in the DNA of his lover, under the pretense of changing her hair color and giving her a vulpine tail and ears. The trait would not effect her, but had the potential to effect her offspring.\nSecond, after her reconstruction, she became pregnant with Emil\u0026rsquo;s child. A child which could easily bear the genes that he was trying so hard to keep from his family. So to prevent the possability of them getting the gene, not to mention his lover and his child, she arranged for him give her a regular steipend, and then disappeared. She changed her name and took up residence somewhere new, but for fear of their child\u0026rsquo;s safety, she could never contact him again.\nSince then, Emil has cloistered himself away on Titan, working in his lab on personal projects and ignoring any and all communication from his family.\nSpoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Future\u0026mdash; title: Emil Frederick, PHD\npermalink: /Emil_Frederick,_PHD/ "

The earliest forms of energy shielding for space craft were nothing more than sophisticated tracking algorithms designed to track incoming debris and then vaporize it with a ship\u0026rsquo;s weapon systems. This system proved to be effective, however costly in terms of computer power, sensor usage, and energy consumption. These systems were adept at eliminating space debris and small particles but proved ineffectual at handling most incoming weapons fire and extremely small matter such as micro-meteorites that could still cause significant damage to a space vessel.\nLater systems took advantage of advances in electromagnetic field manipulation to actually create a high energy barrier between the vessel and oncoming particles which would then simply impact the field and be destroyed by it. This system required nowhere nears as much computer or sensor power, although power consumption actually increased several fold. The benefits outweighed the energy cost in most instances however as these fields would handle weapons fire and all space debris including the microscopic particles that most consumer ship-board sensors were not even capable of tracking. These shields could be manually, or computer controlled to cover specific areas of the ship, i.e.: fore, aft, port, starboard, dorsal, or ventral, but not the entire vessel at once. Multiple fields could be created if multiple field generators, and power plants were installed to support such a set up.\nPresent systems are now tapping the gravitic super-luminal drive systems to create walls, or bubbles of graviton particles that effectively act as a solid wall or physical barrier to incoming matter/weapons fire. These systems are much more energy efficient since they are simply harnessing an existing particle rather than energizing and causing phase shifts on stored particles. These fields envelop the entire vessel and can remain engaged indefinitely in most cases, although multiple, severe, and/or sustained impacts with a graviton shield will draw increasing amounts of power from the ship\u0026rsquo;s generators and cause them to heat up at an accelerated pace, necessitating cool down periods and large/heavy heat syncs/cooling units to be installed along with the field generators.\nThe current generation of gravitic shielding is by far the most common and economical in use today and its refinement is leading to development of more tightly controlled, energy efficient, and smaller artificial gravity systems.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Energy Shields\npermalink: /Energy_Shields/ "

It rests between the Northern and Southern Planes of Serenity, runs up to the Uraval Mountains on the east side and the Great Sea to the west. In the center of the forest rests the Great Inland Sea, a body of water that would take a week to cross in any direction and in the center of which is an island where one of the five ziggurats of Kalijor rests. The areas of the forest that butt up against the Great Inland Sea are by far the oldest, and home to the largest of the Brume Trees and the oldest of the creatures that live in the forest. There are a few roads through the eastern and western portions of the forest, but none through the central areas. In the eastern central portion of the forest, just off the main road there is the portal to the elven city of Pandoria, and in the central western portion of the forest is the monolith tower that is the Magic Academy. Also along the coast on the western edge of the forest there are several fishing villages where hundreds of people have taken up residence and make a living providing sea food to most of the rest of Kalijor.\nThe Forest of Brume is home to a myriad of creatures and animals including bears, goblins, wolves, snakes, a few large cats, giant spiders and even a clan of werepanthers. The forest has a layer of mist, lending to its name, that constantly covers the ground to about a foot depth, making it difficult to see where you are placing your feet as you move through the region. This makes it easy to step on any number of small creatures but also plays on people\u0026rsquo;s nerves more because of the constant sense of movement travelers feel as said small creatures dart out of the way, just out of sight in the mist.\nThe Forest of Brume is the oldest standing forest on the central continent of Kalijor. It is populated almost entirely by Brume Trees which are a slow growing, dense, long fiber hard wood that is perfect for weapons and structural members in construction. However one of the less pleasing qualities of the wood is that is constantly exudes a thick, grey-white mist or fog. The forest floor is constantly obscured by this mist making it easy to trip over roots or other small obstacles. This property seems to stay with the wood, even years after it has been cut and worked into a desired form. This property makes the wood a seldom used choice for most construction projects and most adventurers find it more than a little disconcerting to have themselves constantly surrounded by a thick fog so it is also rarely used in weapon construction.\nFeatures/Places of Note The forest gets older and older the closer one gets to the center where some of the trees can measure their age in millennia. In the heart of the forest is the Great Inland Sea.\nOn the east side of the Great Inland Sea, in the younger forest, lay the portal to Pandoria.\nOn the west side of the Great Inland Sea, almost on the shore of the Endless Ocean is the monolithic Magic Academy.\nThe forest plays host to some of the oldest known living creatures on Kalijor, as well as some of the most powerful. Most of these creatures live deeper in the forest, but occasionally they can be seen by unwary travelers that have wandered off the beaten path. In the younger forest one can encounter, bears, wolves, deer, small birds, and numerous varieties of rodents and insects.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Forest of Brume\npermalink: /Forest_of_Brume/ "

They are basically swords and knives made of high strength alloys. Well balanced weapons with keen cutting edges that are then enhanced by the addition of a high-frequency reciprocating motor that causes the blade to vibrate almost beyond the range of human perception. The end result is a bladed weapon that cuts much like a chain saw. These blades are able to cut through most materials including metal alloys as strong as starship hull plating. High frequency knives are easy to conceal while their larger counterparts are not so easily hidden, but either one is an excellent choice for anyone skilled with a blade to use in their defense.\nEffective Range: Depends upon the length of the blade, anywhere from 1 inch to 72 inches.\nMaximum Range: See Effective Range. These weapons do not make good projectile or thrown weapons.\nPayload: The energy source for the reciprocating motor is the only limiting factor for how long these weapons last. Older versions were powered by high density batteries or hydrogen fuel cells that would typically last 3 to 5 weeks with occasional use. Newer models are outfitted with micro fusion power supplies giving them an effectively limitless life span.\nCategory:Weapons_Future\u0026mdash; title: High-Frequency Blade\npermalink: /High-Frequency_Blade/ "

There are currently two very different technologies in use by space craft. Gravitic drives, and Traction drives.\nGravitic drives harness the power of gravity to propel a space craft faster than the speed of light. By focusing a beam of focused gravitons, the craft is able to push itself away from solid matter with great force. Initially gravitic drives only worked while in relative close proximity to large celestial bodies such as stars and planets, but as the technology was refined it became less dependant on such ‘anchor points’ and is now capable of propelling itself through open space by repelling its graviton beam off of free roaming particles in space. Gravitic drives offer high acceleration characteristics but overall low speeds when compared to traction drives, capable of traveling from twenty to fifty times the speed of light allowing voyages to Sol’s closest neighbors (Around 6 light years distant) to be made in the extremely short time frame of two to five months instead of the previously unheard of time frame of ten years.\nTracton Drives use a relatively new discovery to provide propulsion. Recently (In the last hundred years or so) it was discovered that there are several ‘layers’ of space, both above and below (relatively) our own ‘real space’. These layers of sub-space offered numerous new scientific possibilities as it was discovered that particles behave differently in different layers of space and sub-space. One of these new technologies was sub-space communications, which allows instantaneous communication between extremely distant points in space over dozens of light years. One of the newer developments is a starship drive system that creates an energy field around the ship that allows it to grab on to or ‘grip’ a near-by layer of sub-space and crawl along through real space using that connection to sub-space as traction. Traction drives provide a smooth, constant acceleration and an extremely high (Still unknown at this point) maximum velocity. There is theoretically no maximum velocity for a traction drive; they can keep accelerating indefinitely using a constant amount of energy. With their slow acceleration and deceleration Traction drives are sometimes looked down upon but their unknown maximum velocity tends to help some people overlook the drawbacks. Traction drives can make the same voyages as Gravitic drives in five to sixty percent less time depending upon the distance, the further the trip the faster the drive can go.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Interstellar Travel\npermalink: /Interstellar_Travel/ "

This island is where most of the world’s Fay folk have taken up residence in an attempt to remove themselves from the prying eyes of the overly inquisitive races of the world. The geography of the isle varies immensely from area to area, with steep treacherous cliffs dominating the center and an impassible barrier wall completely encircling the island. The land between these two barriers is lush and full of life of all kinds. There are dense tropical forests, stands of ancient hardwood trees, coniferous forests, open plains, grasslands, and tended orchards of fruit and nut bearing trees, all in different areas of the island, and all populated by various Fay folk, Faeries, Nymphs, Pixies, Sprites, Pucks, Satyrs, and similar. There is also a sizeable population of magical creatures such as unicorn, Pegasus, manticore, gryphon, and the like. Roaming the various treacherous mountain paths in the center of the isle is a variety of elementals representing all four schools. At the top of the mountain in the center of the isle is a large cave that descends deep below the surface of the island and is home to several ancient dragons that have given up their race’s millennia old racial feud and formed a loose coalition with as yet unknown purposes. There is no known way to access the isle of magic via boat or other physical conveyance, as anyone who has tried has never been seen or heard from again, presumably defeated by the impossibly high and sheer cliffs surrounding the island.

His hair has barely discernable darker spots in it and he wears a series of loose braids throughout then ties it all back behind his head to keep it out of the way.\nGeneral Description He is a jovial fellow who follows his passions and helps those in need. He is a loyal friend and honorable warrior. If he has a failing it is that he is deathly afraid of telling people that he is a were-cheetah because of the negative opinions people have about lycanthropes in general. His race has been hunted to near extinction and he is loathe to reveal himself to anyone, even close friends.\nHe is fast without peer over short distances—so fast in fact that when he really puts effort into it, he can move faster than most people are able to see, making it appear as though he teleports. His were-cheetah blood makes him much stronger than a human and he heals so quickly that it appears that he can not be injured, unless he is struck by silver, magic, or magical weapons which will cause wounds that will heal roughly twice as quickly as a humans wounds.\nIn his hybrid form he is six foot six inches tall and twice as strong as in his human form. He is even faster and can maintain his speed over longer distances—several hundred feet as opposed to several dozen feet. In this form he looks like a felinoid, cat ears, cat tail, fur with cheetah spots, standing on two legs with claws on toes and fingers. There is no way he could pass for human in this form.\nIn his cheetah form he is a larger than normal animal at about seven feet from nose to tail tip. He has the ability to speak in rough, broken speech that is barely intelligible. His speed in this form is blisteringly fast, able to cover a mile of ground in a few seconds but requiring him to rest for two or three minutes before he is able to sprint again.\nNo matter what form he is in, his eyes remain their normal cobalt color and his hair is always a very light blond, making him look almost albino in his animal and hybrid forms, but for the spots and eyes. His weapon of choice is a magical sword-staff that breaks apart into two swords with elongated handles and short, thin blades. He is able to use the combination of the magical weapon and his speed to parry/block magical bolts/projectiles with no ill effect to himself.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Spoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Jumah Wataru\npermalink: /Jumah_Wataru/ "

	"content": "It is known that before the great war, the elves and dwarves lived in peace and harmony with one another. Their two great people ruled the land with grace, wisdom, and love for the land and all of its offerings. Both races welcomed the younger races into their arms and began to teach them the way of things, magic, art, culture, life. But as is so often the case, nothing lasts forever.\nAs their powers grew so did their pride. And pride, as you know, is the downfall of any great people. Their pride led to competition between them as they each tried to prove their superiority to the rest of the world. They each created grand armies, equipped with the best magical weapons and armor that had ever been created. They used their power and knowledge to infuse their weapons and armor with additional powers.\nAt long last their pride could be held in check no longer and what is the purpose of an army, if not to wage war? So the dwarves and elves went to war in the name of superiority. The war they waged is said to have gone on for a century as they clashed again and again, changing the face of Kalijor with their anger and might. They fought and they fought until their people were nearly obliterated.\nWhen at last they realized their folly, there were precious few of them left in the world and both of their great empires lay in ruins, Kalijor lay divided and they would never reclaim the glory of their golden age. Instead they receded into the shadows of what forests remained, and what mines could still be worked for metals. They moved off the stage and let the younger races have their hand at the helm.\nFor millennia now they have remained in the background, their numbers never really recovering from the tragedy that was of their own making. The races of men, feline, reptile, taurian and others began building their own empires on Kalijor and, with a subtle guiding hand from the elves and dwarves, they have risen to power in the wake of the great war.\nOver time, as is the case with most great civilizations, the misdeeds of the past were lost to memory and the younger races began to lose sight of their unified purpose. Numerous nations formed and, as is the case with people throughout history, waged wars against one another. Most of the great craftsmen of ages-gone-by had been lost to the Great War however, and those that survived from that time, as elves and dwarves are extremely long-lived peoples, refused to ply their trades in the name of warfare ever again, so the damage to the land was not as complete as was the case in the past.\nThese wars went on for centuries before, at last, a unifying force rose up, calling themselves simply \u0026lsquo;The Guard\u0026rsquo; they recognized the need for the races of Kalijor to get along and move together toward the future. The Guard brought together the leaders of the greatest cities in Kalijor and, over the course of years, negotiated a peace that has endured to this day. Now, the Guard sits quietly in the background, watching the people of Kalijor and sending out their emissaries whenever conflict threatens to break out.\n"

She is fit, but spends the majority of her free time with her nose in a book. She has a thin frame and is not weak, but obviously spends very little time exercising. Her skin is the light color of an elf that spends most of her time indoors and under cover since the majority of their adventures have taken place within the city walls. She has long, metallic platinum hair that, when loose, hangs down to the middle of her back. She has bright, gold eyes and long tapered ears that are extremely expressive of her emotions. Her facial features are delicate, with high cheek bones and thin eyebrows. She is beautiful by most standards and spends some time trying to keep herself presentable, although the effort is really not that great, more of a passing concern that is quickly overridden by her studies.\nGeneral Description Katrina is the twin sister of Riana Thorindal. They grew up together in Rathalon, getting into trouble and generally being kids. They studied together at the Magic Academy where Katrina chose to become a pure Mage, with a focus on spells of destruction and holding.\nKatrina is friendly when approached, but normally looks as though she doesn\u0026rsquo;t want to interact with people because her head is almost always stuck in a book of some kind. She loves to sit in a tavern with her sister while she munches on light snacks and listens to adventurers wander in and out, telling their stories. She tends to be reserved around new people but always gives them the benefit of the doubt. Once someone has proven to her that they are not trustworthy, she will never be inclined to trust them again, but those she calls friend, and those in need will always take precedence in her life.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Katrina was born in the trade city of Rathalon to Ezrina Thorindal. Together with her twin sister, Riana, they grew up learning the ins and outs of the city and its surrounding areas. At the age of ten, their mother enrolled the twins in the Magic Academy where Katrina quickly found a love for the arcane arts.\nWhile her sister was busy skipping classes to sneak out and learn to use a sword, Katrina threw herself into her studies. She quickly established herself as a star pupil and was moved into advanced classes. Over the years of her tenure at the academy she was given special access to some of the higher levels of the Great Library and allowed to assist in research of new and more powerful spells. She received high marks in alchemy and elementalism but decimated the curve in her incantations classes, consistently demonstrating that there was no spell beyond her abilities.\nHer spell book quickly grew in size as she became more and more adept and was eventually invited to assist in the teaching of classes in preparation for becoming a full teacher at the academy when she graduated. However, she surprised the institution when she refused the position and instead, left the academy to travel with her sister in exploring Kalijor.\nSpoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Katrina Annwyn Thorindal\npermalink: /Katrina_Annwyn_Thorindal/ "

Eye Color: Violet Physical Description: Kilishandra was tall for a common elf, she was friendly and outgoing, confident, and intelligent. She had a somewhat cynical sense of humor and was fiercely loyal to anyone she called friend.\nGeneral Description Skills of Note Equipment of Note History Kilishandra was the daughter of an evil elf that called himself Wyndel, and a kind hearted elf from Pandoria named Annwyn. After she was conceived, Annwyn fled from Wyndel and disappeared into the Cohai Observatory under the watchful protection of Master Gornin.\nAfter she was born, Kilishandra had a fairly normal childhood. She attended the Magic Academy to study the arts of magic, and became a powerful mage in her own right; Unaware of the fact that her father was watching her always, from the shadows.\nAfter the academy, Kilishandra fell deeply in love with a homeless orphan half-elf woman named Rhaeton. The two lived in an apartment in Pandoria for a number of years before, through the orchestrations of Wyndel, Rhaeton was killed while protecting Kilishandra from the attack of a mage seeking stolen property that had somehow found its way into Rhaeton’s things. Devastated by the loss, Kilishandra began wandering Kalijor aimlessly, and tried to loose herself for a number of decades, all the while growing in power as she practiced her craft.\nEventually she came into the company of a band of adventurers and they spent a number of years traveling together. Over time Kilishandra developed feelings for an elven ranger named Ambrai, and after she finally built up the courage to tell her of her feelings, she was crushed again as she burst into Ambrai’s inn room in time to watch her profess her love for someone else.\nCrushed again, Kilishandra took to wandering the world once more, but this time she was joined by her close friend Ezrina Reyals, and the two grew ever closer over the ensuing years. Kilishandra eventually developed feelings for Ezrina but by then was so scared to admit her love to another woman that she kept it bottled up inside her.\nOn one of their adventures Kilishandra was stabbed in the ribs by an Obscuri who claimed to be the reincarnated soul of Rhaeton, brought back to do the bidding of Wyndel. He went on to say that the dagger was cursed and would impart a slow and extremely painful death on any who’s blood it tasted as their minds were slowly filled with hate and thoughts of destruction. True to his word, Kilishandra started going slowly mad, and her friends were forced to keep her unconscious to prevent her from hurting herself or others.\nIn an attempt to break the curse, Ezrina tried to destroy the knife, but only succeeded in pricking her finger, thus condemning herself to the same fate as Kilishandra. Finally a solution was devised, by which Kilishandra and Ezrina’s minds could be merged with that of a third person’s and together they could defeat the evil growing within them and destroy the curse. Ambrai quickly volunteered to help and the ritual was performed immediately.\nKilishandra and Ezrina’s minds were restored and the two professed their love for one another, spending a short few days with one another before Kilishandra found out where Wyndel was hiding, and rushing out to confront him. In a titanic battle, the two destroyed one another, Ezrina arriving just in time to hold Kilishandra’s body as she died.\nSpoilers Status: Deceased\nCategory:People_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Kilishandra Thorindal\npermalink: /Kilishandra_Thorindal/ "

She has a bushy, fox-like tail that is also blue, with a white tip, and her ears are slightly pointed, and bear tufts of blue fur sprouting from those tips.\nGeneral Description She is calm, confident, and dresses as appropriate for the occasion, etiher showing off her amazing body for all to see, or conservatively, and she always looks amazing. She has mild empathic abilities, as well as the ability to see auras and instantly recal any fact or piece of information she has ever been exposed to.\nSkills of Note Lana has an extreme talent for, and love of, languages. She learns them in hours, and speaks fluently within days of exposure to a new language.\nSeduction is a skill that she often puts to very good use, and is a talent for which she has developed a taste. She uses her body as a weapon and her years working at the brothel have taught her that sex is just sex when there is no emotion behind it. This allows her to use her body, and mind to best effect in nearly any situation.\nEquipment of Note History Lana grew up the daughter of a working mother. She spent her formative years in the halls of an active brothel, learning everything she could from anyone who would teach her. Her quick wit and sharp eye for detail, not to mention her exotic looks, earned her a large roster of dedicated clients as soon as she was able to take them, and before she knew it she was following in her mother\u0026rsquo;s footsteps. Not that she minded. She loved the work and the variety it offered, and refused to bet tied down, as her mother had, to a single client. Because when that had gone south, it turned their entire world upside down.\nWhen the brothel was mysteriously shut down and Lana was tagged as a potential Dissident sympathizer, it became impossible for her to get new work, so she was forced to rely on existing clients to pay the bills when her mother fell mysteriously ill and died. After that, things continued to get worse, as her loyal clients stopped calling her, one by one, eventually leaving her without income and alone on Venus Station.\nWhen Daray fell into her life, literally, she was at wits end, and unsure what her next step might be. She helped Daray recover from some serious injuries, but was seen by the soldiers that were pursuing her new charge, which forced them both to flee for their lives. The pair quickly grew inseparable and, to this day, work, and live together in their home in Tranquility.\nSpoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Future\u0026mdash; title: Lana Frederick\npermalink: /Lana_Frederick/ "

Lasers have been around for a long, long time, and over the years they have been continually refined, adjusted, and tweaked until they finally became more than simple communications and entertainment tools.\nSince the days of the first laser satellite defense systems the technology has advanced with increasing speed. Basically nothing more than a coherent beam of light at a single, controllable, frequency/wavelength, it was always known that they could be used as weapons, but the big question at hand was always, how do we provide enough energy in a small enough package to make them practical and effective.\nHydrogen power cells heralded the beginning of practical, man-portable laser weapons, although they were still cumbersome and situational at best. The beams, while incredibly powerful, were only good for one shot per fuel cell. This rapid material consumption rate was offset by the weapon\u0026rsquo;s destructive capabilities however, and many military units began to carry a laser weapon with them for similar tasks as a disposable rocket launcher might be used. They also made excellent vehicle mounted weapons as they could be serviced by dedicated, high-output generators and crews.\nWith the advent of high capacity, advanced material batteries and eventually, micro fusion power cells, the laser weapon really came into its own. These advances allowed for much smaller, more practical, multi-use weapons to be developed and eventually reduced them in size to similar dimensions as more conventional projectile weapons. Now laser weapons are available in a myriad of sizes and shapes, all of which are extremely effective weapons when dealing with armor and hardened installations that are not equipped with refractive or ablative armors.\nLasers used against people are somewhat of a dichotomy in that they easily do significant damage, but at the same time they cauterize wounds as quickly as they are made and tend to deaden pain receptors and nerves as they pass through, thereby allowing victims of laser fire to ignore the damage and keep fighting on for as long as their bodies continue to function. For this reason and the fact that human flesh does not tend to stop the beams, allowing for significant collateral damage, they are typically used more against vehicles and armor than against people.\nThe following statistics are representative of nearly all small arms type laser weapons, anything different would either be very custom or more than likely vehicle or ship mounted.\nEffective Range: 15 to 20 miles with proper visibility and optics for aiming.\nMaximum Range: In an atmosphere, approximately 50 to 100 miles, mostly hindered by line of sight and beam attenuation through the gaseous composition of the atmosphere. In the vacuum of space the range of laser weaponry is up to one-hundred times greater than in an atmosphere.\nPayload: Most modern laser weapons have an effectively unlimited payload as they are powered by micro fusion power cells.\nWeapon Class: C\nLaser weapons are considered a controlled commodity and are thusly only available to military and law enforcement organizations. Also, the ease with which a laser beam could rupture a hull and instantly kill hundreds or more people with a poorly placed shot has made their use in contained atmosphere environments (space stations, space craft, and other such pressurized environments contained within otherwise inhospitable or unlivable atmospheres) illegal.\nCategory:Weapons_Future\u0026mdash; title: Laser\npermalink: /Laser/ "

Its people are mostly simple farmers and live stock handlers, with a few artisans having taken up residence as the town becomes more and more popular among wayward adventurers on their way into the Burning Expanse in search of fortune and glory. The government of Loch Moore is simple, made up of a council of residents that meet on a monthly basis to decide any matters of importance. There are indications that this small town may experience a growth spurt in the near future as it becomes more and more the gateway to the sweltering lands to the south.\nLoch Moore is an up-and-coming frontier town that sits on the rather harsh dividing line between the Southern Plain of Serenity and the Burning Expanse. The town is constructed mostly of wood and thatch and is small and mostly pleasant.\nResidents number into the thousands now although the population can fluctuate to as high as ten to fifteen thousand people depending upon what is happening south of the city in the expanse.\nFeatures/Places of Note Loch Moore is home to several reasonable craftsmen that are capable of performing most basic weapon and armor repairs, provide good, hearty meals and rations and several of life\u0026rsquo;s niceties, such as warm baths and clean beds.\nWhile it is by no means a city on par with Rathalon or Talanor it is still a good place to find the basics that you might need on the spot before heading out to seek your fortune.\nLoch Moore is not on the Kalijor portal network, and is at least a few days travel from the nearest city which is Avian, and that is if you have a fast mount. On foot it could take nearly two weeks to make the journey, although occasionally one can find a griffon for hire in Avian that will haul you to Loch Moore for a hefty fee.\nLoch Moore plays host to several inns, numerous taverns, more than one brothel, several smiths and leather workers, provisioners, and it is rumored that one of the largest gathering places for the assassin\u0026rsquo;s guild is somewhere within the limits of this small city.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Loch Moore\npermalink: /Loch_Moore/ "

	"description": "",
	"content": "Lycanthropes are a curiosity in Kalijor. There are two different veins of the race, the canine and the feline. While it is not known how either race originated, what is known is that the different veins propagate differently. The canine lycanthropes pass on their lycanthropy through the exchange of bodily fluids, saliva, blood and the like. They are a particularly aggressive species that is not well liked by any of the other civilized races and due to their inability (or refusal) to accept more civilized ways of living, they have been hunted to near extinction by the rest of the world. Feline lycanthropes can only pass on their lycanthropy through genetic propagation, or the process of normal child bearing. Their bite and bodily fluids are not capable of spreading lycanthropy in any way. In the process of exterminating the canine lycanthropes, most of the felines have been destroyed as well, owing to general paranoia about the “condition” of lycanthropy. Regardless of how it is transmitted, all lycanthropes have certain traits/abilities in common, they are extremely strong, fast, agile, and notoriously difficult to injure. Their bodies heal so quickly that normal wounds disappear before they are ever even seen. In order to seriously harm, or kill a lycanthrope they must be exposed to weapons/implements made of, or coated in pure silver. The only other known means of destroying a lycanthrope is magic which seems to have no diminished effect on them. Lycanthropes are capable of shape-shifting into one of three different forms, that of a human, that of an animal, and that of a hybrid between the two. The hybrid form is their natural state while the other two are alternate forms. Their human guise is always fit and trim, an impeccable specimen of the species with toned muscles and perfect complexion. Their animal form is always at least twice as large as a normal specimen of the species and their eyes remain the same as in their human and hybrid forms, much less animal-like and usually the method used to identify them when in that form. The animal forms that lycanthropes take can vary greatly and are passed on to anyone that “inherits” lycanthropy from the individual in question (so someone bitten by a were-wolf will turn into a were-wolf of similar coloring and marking, not a were-tiger). Canine lycanthropes are savage, wild creatures that seem to be driven mad by their condition, during the day they act feral at best, but under the light of the stars they turn into uncontrollable beasts bent on carnage and destruction. Feline lycanthropes on the other hand are tribal people that live in harmony with their surroundings, welcome travelers/strangers and treat them as family members; however, they have understandably become increasingly reclusive as the war against lycanthropes has waged on, to the point that they are now almost nothing more than a memory to most people. In their hybrid forms they have tails, animal ears and fur covering their entire bodies with longer, human-like hair on their heads. Their animal forms are larger than a comparable animal and bear similar markings in the same variety of patterns and colorations.\nAverage Life Span: Immortal unless killed by violence. The longer a lycanthrope lives, the more powerful, and larger, it becomes.\nAverage Height: 4 to 7 feet in human form. The animal forms vary by species and sub-species, but are typically about 10% to 50% larger than a normal animal of the same type. Hybrid forms are typically 6 to 10 feet tall.\nAverage Weight: 80 to 250 pounds in human form (always fit and trim), 200 to 700 pounds in hybrid form, and 10% to 50% heavier than a normal animal of the same type when in animal form.\nEyes: Blues, greens, browns, hazles.\nHair: Browns, blacks, blonds, reds. Their hair in human form will usually have faintly visible markings that are similar to the markings of their fur in animal form. Also, in animal form they will have a mane of hair that is longer than normal for an animal of that type and in the same color as their human hair.\n"

The structure itself is something of a curiosity. A two-hundred foot high monolith of solid stone set in a small clearing in the western Forest of Brume, it has one door at it\u0026rsquo;s base and can be walked around in less than a minute. Once you open the door the curiosity of the structure becomes apparent, as the interior is substantially larger than the exterior. Inside the monolith is a school that houses no only the classrooms but the dormitories, laboratories, kitchen facilities, libraries, and housing for staff and instructors.\nThe Magic Academy is a city unto itself, housing thousands of students and instructors on a daily basis. The academy has most of its day to day operations handled by the students themselves, things like cleaning and maintenance. They have a dedicated cooking staff but the students perform all of the clean-up tasks. While it is certainly possible to become an adept mage without attending the academy, there is no better place to receive a first rate education in the arts.\nThe Magic Academy is also home to the largest and most well maintained library in Kalijor, their great library is at least ten times the size of the Rathalon stacks and their librarians have a magical link with their tomes that allows them to instantly divine the location of a book based on author, subject, or even specific content. There is also a restricted section to the great library that is the home for any and all tomes that are deemed to be of sufficiently advanced or questionable power. In order to enter the restricted stacks it is first necessary to speak with the arch magus of the academy and obtain their special written permission to do so.\nThe normal enrollment period at the Academy is ten years from start to finish and includes six years of study in the basic arts and then anther four years of study in the student\u0026rsquo;s area of specialization. After this ten year period most students head out into the world to seek their fortunes, but some will stay on and learn much more advanced magics or even join the staff and take on students of their own.\nFeatures/Places of Note The Magic Academy exists in Kalijor as a large monolith on the western edge of the world, facing the Endless Ocean. The monolith is approximately fifty feet on a side and has a square base with a single large door on its north face.\nInside the monolith is an enormous facility that is home at any given time to nearly five-thousand individuals. It is the home of most of the more powerful mages in Kalijor as well as the largest repository of written knowledge in the world.\nAs its name implies, the Magic Academy is where most mages and people who utilize magical incantations study their arts. This includes spell-swords as well, although their tenure is usually very short.\nAdmittance to the Magic Academy requires that individuals are attuned to the doorways. A process that can only be performed by one of the resident mages. Arrivals to the portal chamber will encounter a locked door similar to that in Cohai, however the residents are much quicker to respond.\nThe Academy is broken down into several levels, each of which requires a different level/type of attunement to be accessed, this allows people to be permitted entry to certain specific areas and kept out of others.\nThe academy library, known throughout Kalijor as \u0026lsquo;the great library\u0026rsquo; is also divided into several levels, all on the upper floors of the academy and the content becomes more and more sensitive as one climbs higher in the academy, with the topmost level being restricted to all but a handful of individuals in the entire world.\nThe Magic Academy is guarded on every level and at every entrance/exit by extremely powerful Mages and Spell-Swords that will not hesitate to enforce order should issues arise.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Magic Academy\npermalink: /Magic_Academy/ "

Thousands of large, domed structures house the cities and facilities of the people that live there. The primary industries on Mars are agriculture and manufacturing of spaceship and space station components for export off-world.\nThe population of Mars is near four billion, nearly all of which are permanent residents. Mars is viewed by many people as a sort of trailer park community that is unpalatable to most people\u0026rsquo;s senses. Most attribute this fact to the dull light and ruddy color of the surface of the planet, saying that it induces depression and sloth in human beings. Most of the people who live there however, tend to like it and stay there by choice for the most part, so it is difficult to say where the feeling of dislike for the planet really originates.\nFeatures/Places of Note The two largest cities on Mars are Achilles, and Hector.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Mars\npermalink: /Mars/ "

Its sole purpose for existence is to act as a go-between for imports/exports to and from Mars proper, and as a place for tired spacers to stop and unwind a bit between trips. There is a thriving black market on Mars Station that the Conglomerate continues to ignore due to the Earth’s and Luna’s dependence upon Martian exports of food and goods.\nThe Mars Station is now more of a third-world country than a center of commerce.

The environment is unclean, the infrastructure for waste disposal and clean water distribution is in constant need of repair and power is available in some areas only intermittently.\nThe hallways are filled with merchant\u0026rsquo;s tents that are set up alongside ramshackle tents and lean-to\u0026rsquo;s where those that are unable to afford their own housing make their homes. The people that live here re generally of two different types, the squalidly poor, unable to even look someone else in the eyes, and the immensely rich, unwilling to give anyone else the time of day.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government History The Mars Station is a large space station that was built in geosynchronous orbit around the red planet hundreds of years ago. The original purpose of the station was to allow larger vessels to dock in orbit and allow smaller vessels to haul goods to and from the planet at a much reduced cost. It quickly grew into a center of commerce for the Sol system since nearly all food was grown on the surface of the planet.\nAs technology changed the cost and value of space travel, and made much smaller, faster, more affordable ships capable of hauling more and more cargo, the station was used less and less for its original midway purpose and more for general habitation.\nAs the years progressed, the station was added to and modified to accommodate more and more people until it now no longer even resembles its original design.\nSpoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Mars Station\npermalink: /Mars_Station/ "

Before this event, any complete alterations of an individual\u0026rsquo;s DNA were made to zygot before implantation in a parent/host for normal gestation, or to be grown in an artificial womb. The only \u0026lsquo;live\u0026rsquo; DNA alterations made before this breakthrough expirament were extremeley minor and took months, or years, to become outwardly visible. Things such as altering a person\u0026rsquo;s hair, or eye color, or skin pigmentation.\nBy contrast, \u0026lsquo;Mary\u0026rsquo; represented an entirely new technique and technology for genetic manipulation. For this test, a young transgendered male named Robert had nearly every aspect of his biology altered by computer controlled RNA retrovirus transmitters. The process involved a forced \u0026lsquo;flushing\u0026rsquo; and \u0026lsquo;transfusion\u0026rsquo; of the subject\u0026rsquo;s cells in an aquious solution designed to emulate the human womb during pregnancy. The process essentially involved the liquification, transfusion, and resolidification of the subject\u0026rsquo;s entire body through careful computer control and atomic manipulation.\nThe entire human race watched the televised event as Robert\u0026rsquo;s body was slowly digested, leaving not much more than his brain and spinal column intact, and was then rebuilt cell by cell into Mary, a perfectly healthy and biologically functional young woman. However it is important to note that while only human DNA coding was used in Mary\u0026rsquo;s reconstruction, it was made abundantly clear that any genetic code could be seamlessly intigrated into a person\u0026rsquo;s makeup, with no possibility of rejection or unforseen (biological) consequences.\nThis test case opened the doors for human customization on a massive scale and catapaulted T.R.I.P. to the top of the Conglomerate\u0026rsquo;s membership. Additionally, the ensuing rush of individuals seeking genetic reconstruction both ballooned T.R.I.P.\u0026rsquo;s net worth and began the slow spiral of the human race toward the events that culminated in The Purge.\n"

To make a melee weapon that is as sharp as you can possibly make it and will, in the hands of the correct wielder, be an extremely effective weapon. In the case of these weapons there is a wire or filament that is formed from a super dense alloy (although really almost any substance will work as long as it is ferrous). The wire is extruded to be only one molecule thick and thus it will, when it comes into contact with other materials, act as a cutting edge of incredible power, acting on the molecular bonds that hold materials together. The final step in constructing a monomolecular weapon is to suspend the wire in a powerful, shaped magnetic field that keeps it rigid and able to be wielded like a sword or knife. These weapons are extremely expensive to produce, amazingly concealable (the wire is retracted into the handle when the weapon is turned off) and exceptionally balanced. However, they are dangerous in the extreme, to everyone near by, even he wielder. As such they are very rare to see.\nEffective Range: Depends upon the length of the wire or \u0026lsquo;blade\u0026rsquo;, anywhere from 1 inch to 72 inches.\nMaximum Range: See Effective Range. These weapons do not make good projectile or thrown weapons.\nPayload: The energy source for the magnetic field is the only limiting factor for how long these weapons last. Older versions were powered by high density batteries or hydrogen fuel cells that would typically last 3 to 5 weeks with occasional use.

The region plays host to all manner of animals and creatures including elk, large hunting cats, and great white bears. The deeper one travels into the region the more aggressive the creatures become. In the center of the Northern Wastes is a large mound topped with one of the five ziggurats of Kalijor that are reputed to be the resting place of ancient Obscuri artifacts created before the wars. On the mound, surrounding the ziggurat a clan of giants has taken up residence, their thick skins protecting them from the cold and their unpleasant attitudes keeping the place clear travelers.\nThe Northern Wastes is a frigid, inhospitable region that lay in a large depression in the Gelid Mountains, northwest of Mount Tellamon. This region is constantly under the cloud of winter and its temperatures rarely rise above about ten degrees below zero Celsius.\nThere are near-constant blizzard conditions here and a traveler can rarely see more than twenty feet ahead of themselves.\nFeatures/Places of Note Animals here include a few elk, wolves, and some large hunting cats and bears in addition to some small rodents.\nAs one moves deeper into the area there is a strange rock formation that is extremely large and stepped as it rises out of the ground like a massive pyramid. It would be extremely difficult to ascend under the best of circumstances but here it is an exercise in insanity. Partially due to the weather, but the futility of the act is reinforced by the giants that prowl the strange structure.

Long ago, during the ancient wars that threatened to destroy all of Kalijor, a group of elves developed new forms of immensely powerful magic which they used to imbue a number of artifacts with supernatural abilities unheard of previously. These elves then used these items to bring peace to Kalijor. But the peace was short lived as other races began to realize what level of power these elves had achieved. As most of the world started beating at the doors of their city the elves quickly came to a decision. They decided that their knowledge was nothing the world could have, it was simply too powerful. So they sealed away their artifacts within a series of ziggurats around the world and then disappeared from the face of Kalijor. Over the following centuries, they have developed into a race of light, almost pale white skinned elves that make their home in a series of inky black caves at the top of the Uraval Mountains .

Their physical size and appearance varies wildly based upon what region they hail from and orcs are unique among most other species of Kalijor in that they very quickly develop physical adaptations to better help them survive in their environment. As an example, it has been noted that orcs that are forced to vacate their lands for new environments will develop new skin coloration and markings and even dramatically change size to better acclimatize themselves to their new environs. Orcs that live in cold climates tend to be white, grey, dark blue or even black with markings usually in opposing colors (i.e.: black markings on white skin), while orcs living in forested regions will usually be brown, green, black or red, again with markings in opposing colors. Orcs living in large open expanses tend to be physically larger and stronger than those living in confined or enclosed areas where smaller sizes are of much more benefit to mobility. All orcs have long tusks on their lower jaws that protrude upwards out of their mouths and cover portions of their faces and their eyes are almost always black as obsidian. Most orcs will completely adjust physically to a new environment within a year of continuous exposure to the conditions therein.\nOrcs are generally unpleasant creatures that have learned that it is much easier to take what they want at the point of a weapon than to produce anything of their own. As such they have no real industry or marketable skills aside from the waging of wars, at which they have become exceedingly efficient. It is extremely rare to find an orc that has given up its tribal ways in favor of any form of civilized living. Such things do happen from time to time but even then the creatures are looked down upon and treated with mistrust by nearly all other \u0026lsquo;civilized\u0026rsquo; races.

The only way to get to Pandoria is by one of the two portals that connect it to Kalijor. One is in the great portal chamber in Rathalon and the other is a larger portal that is deep within the forest of Brume . The city itself is grown into a forest of massive hardwood trees that are magically grown and shaped by Druids to suit the needs of the city and its inhabitants. All of the trees are living, breathing trees that range in size from five-hundred to two-thousand feet in diameter and miles high. The floor of the forest is covered in a soft, short bladed grass that is cool and comfortable, and in the center of the tree city is a lake of crystal clear, warm water. The boughs of the trees have been magically woven into roads and ramps that lead up and down, and from tree to tree creating an elaborate web of ramps and access ways that can be difficult to navigate for a newcomer to the city. Pandoria is a monarchy; the ruling family is a line of elves that can trace their lineage back to the creation of Kalijor, millennia ago. Their family name is Reyals and they have always been kind, benevolent rulers, well liked by the people of the city.\nPandoria is something of an enigma in the world of Kalijor. Largely because it is not actually ~in~ the world of kalijor. Pandoria is the last remaining organized elven city and it has been created inside a small pocket dimension that exists outside of Kalijor. There is a large permanent portal in the Forest of Brume that allows two-way travel to and from Pandoria.\nFeatures/Places of Note The city of Pandoria is grown into and on a forest of immense trees. Trees that are so large that it could take the better part of a day to walk around the base of one. The ground around the trees is carpeted with soft, well-manicured, lush, green grass and in the center of the city is a large lake with crystal clear water where the children of the city play daily.\nThe temperature is always comfortable and the light during the day is bright, but filtered through the leaves of the great trees, far overhead. The weather is always mild with occasional soft, warm rain showers.\nThe city itself is grown into and onto the surface of the trees through the use of druidic magic. This is done without harming the trees and the people of the city live in harmony with their environment. The branches of the trees have been grown and woven together to form walkways and roads between the trees. There are merchant \u0026lsquo;tents\u0026rsquo; grown into the bark of the trees and along the branches/roadways and gentle slopes leading up and down to the various levels of the city, and eventually down to ground level.\nOn one side of the lake in the center of the city is a large tree stump, some one hundred feet high and still growing new branches and leaves. Inside this stump is the temple of Druids where druidic magic has been taught for centuries to those that are in tune enough with nature to learn it.\nThe Pandoria portal chamber is a large room, high up in one of the largest trees. It is a huge room, nearly the size of the Rathalon portal chamber. It is supported by several thick, wooden pillars that support the higher portions of the tree, and the floor of the chamber is worn smooth over centuries of foot traffic.\nThe portal chamber, portal to the Forest of Brume and other key locations around Pandoria are all guarded by a small, well trained fighting force that is comprised largely of druids.\nGovernment The government in Pandoria is a monarchy where the ruling family, the Reyals family, has been in power since Pandoria was created after the great war. The Reyals family is well liked by the residents of Pandoria and it looks as though they will be in power there for many centuries to come.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Pandoria\npermalink: /Pandoria/ "

Essentially they are very similar to rail guns or electromagnetic mass drivers except that they use electrostatic forces rather than electromagnetic, and they are firing beams of particles rather than solid slugs or projectiles.\nParticle beam weapons faced many of the same problems as laser weapons in the early days of directed energy weapon development, and most of the issues that solved lasers for practical application also made particle beam weapons a reality as well. In practical application, particle beams are actually better weapons for use in enclosed and pressurized, self contained environments since the damage caused by a particle beam weapon is very similar to the damage caused by a ballistic projectile. The added benefit being that particle beams have a nearly instant hit (since the beam travels near the speed of light there is no need to \u0026lsquo;lead\u0026rsquo; your target in order to compensate for the travel time of the projectile) and there is no need to carry extra ammunition for a particle beam since the newest weapons distil the particles they need to fire out of normal, breathable atmosphere (space based particle beam weapons however, DO need a ready supply of particles and thusly, a reservoir of gas or atmosphere to consume over the normal process of firing).\nEffective Range: In an atmosphere, 1 to 2 miles.

It is covered in a thick, reddish-orange silt-like material that is just moist enough to stick to everything, but doesn\u0026rsquo;t carry enough moisture to actually prove useful for anything. There are several species of crawling weeds and tangling vines that creep across the surface of the plane but they too are good for nothing but tripping up unfortunate travelers in the area. In the northern area of the plane stands the lonely volcano, at the base of which is the city of Bête Noire. In the south is the Dead Sea and somewhere in the center of the region is one of the five ziggurats of Kalijor, and an ancient castle that has been claimed by an ancient arch lich. The Plane of Sorrow is crawling with undead creatures of every sort from zombies to skeletons, ghouls, ghasts, wraiths, and similar. No travelers are ever safe anywhere within the region at any time.\nThe Plain of Sorrow is a dreary, inhospitable region that is covered in a fine, ruddy orange dirt that is just moist enough to stick to everything a traveler owns, but not so moist as to be of any use for the reclamation of water. Nothing edible grows here and the land is almost completely flat with only the occasional swell to the ground, although most are not even tall enough to obscure a traveler\\\u0026rsquo;s line of sight, insuring that they can always see the far-off, bleak, dark, foreboding horizon.\nFeatures/Places of Note There is almost no small game here although the occasional creeping weed or shrub may attract some tiny rodents to its roots, since its leaves are completely inedible. This terrain goes on for thousands of miles and is only broken up by the occasional landmark.\nIn the northeastern part of the Plain of Sorrow stands the ominous mountain of Bête Noire with its patron city sprawled around its base. Somewhere in the northwestern are of the region stand the ruined pyramids of some ancient, lost civilization, now inhabited by their undead remains.\nIn the south of the region is the desiccated remains of a once great forest that surrounds the Dead Sea.\nIt is rumored that somewhere in the middle of this horrid place lay two landmarks of significance, one being the castle of the Lich King, the other being an ancient temple of unknown origin and pupose.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Plain of Sorrow\npermalink: /Plain_of_Sorrow/ "

It was carved by the best dwarven craftsmen in the world along with assistance from some of the cleverest mages since the great wars. Not a single piece of stone was added to the city during its construction. Even the doors are carved from the stone where they stand, and are operated through magical enchantments. The city has running hot and cold water and waste removal, all provided through an intricate system of plumbing and magical portals. It is the center of commerce on Kalijor with magical portals that go to and from each of the other five cities in the world. Rathalon is governed by a group called the city council, which is comprised of eleven public servants who are selected by public lottery from all residents of the city. The term of service on the city council is one year, during which time the meager sales taxes of the city pays for the upkeep of the individual’s properties. Their wages are paid out of the city coffers and they are given an office and sleeping quarters within the council building in the “palace” of Rathalon. These officials are not required to stay at the palace, but often they are needed on short notice, so most choose to sleep there and see their families during daylight hours when business is not pressing. After their one year of service they are released back to their normal lives, and are exempted from the next ten public lotteries. The city council operates on a system of republic democracy where the eleven members vote on matters of state after hearing the concerns of the citizens at council. Anyone that wishes to be heard on an issue need simply show up during council sessions and raise their hand. Rathalon is defended by a standing army that is equipped with some of the best dwarven and elven crafted magical weapons and armor that is available in Kalijor.\nRathalon is positioned at the north end of the Uraval Mountains and is home to more than a million sentients. The city was carved from the face of the mountains and is one of the greatest achievements of dwarven craftsmanship in the history of the world. In Rathalon, everything is made of the original stone that was part of the mountain range and almost nothing was brought in or added from outside. Nearly all of the doors, gates, grates and other moving pieces are made of stone as well. This is acomplished through the use of magic that allows the stone slabs to be moved, or even move on their own. All of Rathalon is provided with fresh, clean, hot and cold running water, and automated waste disposal systems as part of its enchanted infrastructure.\nAt any given time there are more than a million transients in the city, most of which can find room and board in the cliff apartments for reasonable rates, or the more luxurious inns in the city proper if they are willing to spend a little more coin.\nFeatures/Places of Note Rathalon is the hub of the Kalijor portal system, housed in the great portal chamber. Within this chamber are six raised daises surrounding an arcade of pillars with a large, sunken area in its center. Five of the six daises have floating columns of glowing rings atop them, these are the out-bound portals to the other major cities of Kalijor and travelers have but to step into a column of rings to be instantly transported to the city that the rings are connected to. Connected cities are: Talanor, Pandoria, Avian, Cohai, and The Magic Academy.\nThe large, sunken area in the center of the chamber is where all arrivals from the other cities appear. This chamber is always heavily guarded and extremely busy, night and day.\nNear the portal chamber is the Rathalon Bazaar which is an enormous structure where merchants can set up booths and tables to sale their wares out of the elements. It is akin to a giant indoor shopping mall and is large enough to house more than onehundred-thousand people at a time. Just keep an eye on your coin purse when things get busy.\nRathalon is protected by a standing army that is known as the Rathalon Guard. These soldiers are among the best trained, well equipped, and most capable fighting forces in Kalijor. Their standard equipment includes a suite of dwarven crafted plate armor and their signature weapon which is a short staff with a long, straight blade on either end.\nGovernment The government in Rathalon is a republic in which all citizens over the age of eighteen have their names put into a lottery. Each year there is a lottery drawing where eleven names are drawn. These eleven people become the governing body of the city for that year and are known as \u0026lsquo;The Council of Elders\u0026rsquo;. All policy decisions are made through majority vote of these eleven people. Anyone who wants to make a case or present information to the council can do so on a weekly basis when open forums are held.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Rathalon\npermalink: /Rathalon/ "

Their skin is covered in scales that range from medium to coarse in texture and a variety of patterns and ridges can be seen from family line to family line. They have long, pointed teeth that are designed to rip and tear flesh, which is their sole source of nutrition, providing both food and liquid for their bodies. They do imbibe the occasional drink when in the company of other races but this is more a social nicity than anything else as they derive no value what so ever from doing so and are in fact entirely unaffected by alcohol and any other poisons or toxins that are ingested orally.\nScale colorations range all over but usually have either a green, yellow, or black base to them. They are physically strong (MUCH stronger than they look in most cases) and extremely intelligent. Reptilians make superb mages, martial artists, scholars, politicians, and merchants.\nAverage Life Span: 100 to 500 years.\nAverage Height: 3 to 8 feet.\nAverage Weight: 90 to 500 pounds.\nEyes: Black, yellow, or red.\nHair: Typically none, occasionally black or white.\n"

She was jaded at an an early age due to circumstances but still tried to keep a sense of humor about her, even if it was a bit dry and had a mean streak. Once she called someone friend she would throw herself in front of any force to save them.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Rhaeton was a half-elf orphan living in Pandoria when Kilishandra was young, just out of the Magic Academy. Kilishandra caught Rhaeton trying to flee an angry cook after she had stolen a loaf of bread from his kitchen. Rhaeton was amazed when Kilishandra paid for the bread and sent the cook on his way, and then invited Rhaeton to stay with her until she could start earning some money and get a place of her own.\nRhaeton did eventually start making some money, using her skills as a rogue to help the defenders in Pandoria track down criminals and running scouting missions for them, but the two never parted ways. Rhaeton and Kilishandra had developed strong feelings for one another over the years and eventually consummated their relationship and agreed to live together forever. But it was not meant to be.\nOne day the two were confronted by an enraged mage who had somehow found his stolen spell book in Rhaeton’s belongings. During the confrontation that followed Rhaeton ended up stepping in front of a fireball meant for Kilishandra, who had entered the fray in defense of her lover, and died on the spot.\nDecades later, she was reincarnated by a powerful mage named Wyndel, into a male Obscuri body. Wyndel filled Rhaeton’s head with images of Kilishandra and Ezrina and told him/her that he/she could have Kilishandra back if he/she was to kill her with a magical dagger, freeing her spirit so that the two could mingle forever in the afterlife. Twisted by his/her time in the spirit world, and the lies constantly spoken by Wyndel, Rhaeton took up the dagger and tracked down his/her former lover.\nAfter he/she stabbed Kilishandra with the dagger, Rhaeton surrendered him/herself over to Kilishandra’s friends and told them the story of how he/she came to be there, and of Wyndel and his plans. They kept him/her locked up until Kilishandra and Wyndel destroyed one another, at which point Wyndel’s spell ended and Rhaeton returned to oblivion, his/her new body crumbling to dust.\nSpoilers Status: Deceased\nCategory:People_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Rhaeton\npermalink: /Rhaeton/ "

She is extremely fit, spending a great deal of time in physical training/conditioning. She is deceptively strong for her size, with a svelte frame and great muscle tone. Her skin is the light color of an elf that spends most of her time indoors and under cover since the majority of their adventures have taken place within the city walls. She has long, dark purple hair that, when loose, hangs down to the middle of her back, although she usually keeps it up in a ponytail. She has deep violet eyes and long tapered ears that are extremely expressive of her emotions. Her facial features are delicate, with high cheek bones and thin eyebrows (also dark purple in color). She is beautiful by most standards although she would never admit it, or even think about it, and spends almost no time trying to enhance her looks in any way.\nIn Kalijor, Riana is of average height for an elf of royal blood (although she had no idea until she and Katrina were out adventuring that they were of royal descent).\nIn the real world Riana looks to have an athletic build, despite her weight which is caused by her unique body. Save for the absence of her mystical tattoos, Riana looks identical in Kalijor to the way she appears in the real world.\nGeneral Description She does her best to live a normal life but keeps finding herself in strange situations. She is an accomplished martial artist, studying under Master Jonin, loves to fly The Kestrel whenever she can and has a crush on one Vincent Torres.\nInformation: Riana is the twin sister of Katrina Thorindal. They grew up together in Rathalon, getting into trouble and generally being kids. They studied together at the Magic Academy where Riana chose to become a Spell-Sword, with a focus on spells of destruction and holding.\nIn the real world, Riana is a cyborg of extremely advanced design (she could be called an android except that she as many organic parts). Her bones are a composite of a titanium-like alloy wrapped around a honeycomb of high strength carbon-carbon. Her muscle tissue is an advanced Kevlar-like material with a massively stronger tensile strength than any human tissue, genetically augmented or otherwise and her skin is grown around interwoven layers of reactive fibrous armor. Her senses, muscles, and reflexes have all been tuned to their utmost capabilities, well beyond human potential and that of most cybernetic technology of the day. Her mind is interfaced directly with an advanced computer system that increases her comprehension, retention, and recall capabilities as well. In point of fact, she has so few organic systems that she is more android than cyborg, although her brain, spinal column and, in fact, her entire nervous systems are all organic. Her nervous system is a cloned copy of Willhelmina Orlova\u0026rsquo;s, with some minor tweaks to accommodate both Riana\u0026rsquo;s unique consciousness and the organic/machine interface.\nRiana is friendly and outgoing, eager to meet new people and hear their tales of adventure. She loves to sit in a tavern and munch on light snacks while watching adventurers wander in and out, telling their stories. She assumes the best about people until they prove to be unworthy of her trust and will go to great lengths for a friend or anyone in need of help.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Riana Thorindal was born to Ezrina Thorindal in the trade city of Rathalon. As a young elf, she and her twin sister Katrina spent most of their time exploring the city and getting into whatever trouble they could scrounge up. They learned the ins and outs of the city and all of its secret highways and byways until they were ten, at which point they were enrolled at the Magic Academy to begin practicing the mage arts.\nPartway through her second year at the Magic Academy, Riana began skipping some of her classes in order to sneak out to a local fishing village where an old adventurer was teaching her the art of the sword. For several years she kept her sword practice a secret from her mother, but she knew she could not keep up the lies for long.\nIn her fifth year at the academy, she was playing with some enchantments in one of the academy alchemy labs when the compound she was working on exploded in her face (due to the fact that she did not remember the appropriate protection spell to keep her volatile compound in check). The result of the explosion, she was officially suspended from the academy labs and all of her hair began to grow out in a thick, dark, purple color from that day forward.\nFor a few months she tried dying her hair so as to hide the new color from her mother but eventually she gave up trying to keep her secret. She told her mother that she had been skipping classes in order to study sword play and stopped dying her hair. Her mother surprised her by saying she knew about the classes and further, by giving her a new, dwarven short sword that she had commissioned specifically for Riana.\nAfter that day, Riana spent half her day at the academy in her incantation classes (both offensive and defensive), and the other half in the fishing village with the weapon-master, learning the art of the sword. Over time she began to integrate her skills and became a true spell-sword.\nThe twin\u0026rsquo;s adventures led them all over the northern-half of the Plain of Serenity and into the Southern Wastes. They got into a lot of trouble, but also managed to accumulate some acclaim through their adventures. During her final term at the Magic Academy, Riana spent a great deal of time and energy researching ancient languages and symbolism, even going so far as to sneak into the restricted levels of the Great Library in order to formulate a series of special inks, incantations, and markings that allowed the dwarven artisan, Dinendal, to apply her magical tattoos. The markings cover the majority of her body below her neck and all appear as a series of black, interlocking, almost tribal tattoos. However when she concentrates on casting a particular spell, the tattoo that represents that spell will glow into bright, vivid color (as do her eyes) as the effect of the spell is produced. Invoking the power associated with the magical tattoos causes her to experience symptoms of physical exhaustion, increasing in severity as the power of the spell increases. The exhaustion is not so bad that it knocks her out immediately, more like each spell having the same effect of having jogged around the base of a tree for a few minutes. The trick is that the effects are cumulative and she can wear herself out quickly if she is in physical combat and using her magic as well.\nA side effect of her tattoos is that she is no longer able to cast spells through the normal means of memorizing the incantations and reciting them. Instead, she must research the spell\u0026rsquo;s effects, find an appropriate marking and formulate a compatible, enchanted ink. Then she must have the mark permanently applied to her body in order to invoke the spell. When she first had the tattoos applied, she included a great many spells that she did not yet know how to control, and as a result she still has a lot of research to do in order to increase her understanding of the spells enough to actually invoke them.\nSpoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Kalijor Category:People_Future\u0026mdash; title: Riana Shandra Thorindal\npermalink: /Riana_Shandra_Thorindal/ "

	"content": " title: Riana\u0026rsquo;S Body desc:\ndate: 2019/01/25 version: 1.0.0 template:\nnav: Riana\u0026rsquo;S_Body percent: 100 authors:\nRiana’s cybernetic body is arguably a product of the most advanced and forward thinking technology known to mankind. It is designed to almost perfectly mimic a normal human body in nearly every way as far as construction and structure are concerned, but enhances, strengthens, and builds upon that construction and form immeasurably. Her skeleton is composed of a carbon-carbon honeycomb that is laced/reinforced and sheathed in 6.6.2 Titanium. This makes her bones both extremely light, and incredibly resilient to breaking, shattering and other forms of damage.\nHer muscles are made from a high tensile strength flexible fiber similar to Kevlar that is molecularly bonded to her bones at the appropriate attachment points. This allows her body to move in the same ways as a normal human body and have identical outward appearance but increases strength reflexes and flexibility thousands of times over the original model.\nAll of her internal organs are cybernetic replicas of the normal human versions, which save space and increase efficiency over said systems. Her cybernetic organs are capable of keeping her operating at peak efficiency for extreme lengths of time, bordering on indefinite, and are capable of filtering out toxins, foreign chemicals and all other such potentially harmful (Or beneficial) substances. Thus she is incapable of being poisoned but at the same time, a simple anesthetic or pain killer would also have no effect on her. She still has a rudimentary digestive system that is used to supply nutrients to her nervous system and epidermis, but her specific nutritional requirements are actually very minimal. She could conceivably live indefinitely on simple sucrose in the absence of normal or more plentiful sources of nutrients.\nHer nervous system is a cloned human nervous system that has been fully integrated into the cybernetic body and genetically optimized for neurotransmitter speed and efficiency. Her neurons and brain operate at the peak of human potential, far beyond what nearly all human beings have ever dreamed possible. She has full use of one-hundred percent of her brain as opposed to the ten percent we generally use, although she is still limited by her ‘human’ experiences and is still discovering things about her potential on a daily basis. Also, integrated into her brain is a cybernetic computer interface that allows her to connect to and use external computer devices via direct mental input/control. This connection operates at the speed of thought (Just short of one-hundred eighty six thousand miles per second or the speed of light) and is a much more intuitive interface, especially for Riana as she is just now learning to use computers and electronic equipment.\nHer epidermis is composed of alternating layers of a woven, high tensile strength fiber that is used in reactive armors. Her actual organic skin is grown on and through this layered weave giving her the look and feel of normal skin upon quick evaluation. However upon closer scrutiny her skin will be firmer than a normal person’s due to the material that is fused with the organic portion of her epidermis. Her skin is tear and cut resistant and will stop all small and medium caliber projectiles with minimal damage, and the reactive nature of the woven material which is linked into the computer portion of her nervous system will even help minimize the damage from larger projectiles and explosions/concussive force. The woven material is used in thinner layers in areas of her body that need to be more expressive/flexible or pass under more intense scrutiny such as the face, genitals, hands, toes, and joints in the arms and legs.\nHer entire body is inhabited by trillions of nanites that constantly monitor and repair/maintain her body, repairing damage and making sure everything is normal. Whenever damage is incurred at any location, the microscopic robots rush to that location and begin effecting repairs. Their first priority is to stop hemorrhaging, then move on to repairing critical systems. Any bullets or debris that are detected inside the body, such as bullets, shrapnel and so forth are metabolized by the nanites and reused as base material for the needed repairs. Because the nanites break down these materials at the molecular level, there is no known substance that they can not absorb. These materials are used to construct more nanites, repair damage to the body and to produce other effects. Although Riana is not yet fully aware of it she is able to consciously control the nanites to produce desired effects such as taking control of security systems, invading remote computer systems without direct connection through her neural interface and a host of other abilities. The nanites are powered off of the tiny electrical currents within her body and are self replicating/repairing.\nStatistically speaking:\nHeight: 6 feet 1 inch\nWeight: 350 pounds (She looks to weigh around 120 pounds but the density of the materials that she is constructed of adds significant weight).\nHair: Royal purple (Her hair is actual living hair that grows and its natural color is purple).\nEyes: Violet (Her eyes are artificial and allow her to see into the ultraviolet and infrared spectrums of light, as well as offering thermal vision and telescopic vision, she is able to read a 2 foot sign up to 2 miles away in daylight. In darkness using alternate vision modes her sight range is significantly reduced to around 1500 feet).\nPhysical Strength: With her inhibitor collar disabled Riana is able to dead lift up to 6000 pounds, and carry 2000 pounds indefinitely. With her collar turned on her strength is variable depending on what settings are used. She could have no muscle control at all, incapable of movement in any form, all the way up to just short of her full capability.\nRunning Speed: With her inhibitor collar disabled Riana can run up to 120 miles per hour indefinitely. With her collar enabled her speed can vary anywhere from completely immobile to just short of her maximum speed.\nJumping Ability: With the inhibitor collar disabled Riana can jump 15 feet straight up or 20 feet across from a standing position. With a running start she can triple those distances, 45 feet high and 60 feet across. With the inhibitor collar activated her jumping can be limited to complete immobility and range all the way up to her maximum ability.\nReflex Response: Her finely tuned nervous system, in conjunction with computer assisted response analysis allows Riana to react hundreds of times faster than a highly trained human. Her neurotransmitters conduct 500 times faster than normal human nerves. In addition, her ability to instantly analyze statistical probability enables her to act preemptively, anticipating opponent’s moves/actions and giving some people the unnerving feeling that she is somehow reading their minds.\nHealing: The nanites in her body heal any small wounds/damage almost immediately. Small arms fire will leave marks on her body like ugly bruises, sometimes breaking the skin and drawing some blood, but these marks are usually repaired within an hour depending upon availability of nanites. Larger caliber weapons will penetrate deeper causing tissue tearing and greater amounts of blood loss. Large wounds like these are handled with higher priority by the nanites, but take longer to repair, typically 12 to 24 hours to erase all signs of the wound. If a bone or joint is somehow broken it can be repaired within 24 to 48 hours depending upon the thickness of the bone and the severity of the breakage. Repairs are prioritized according to severity and whether or not they will affect survivability.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Riana\u0026rsquo;s Body\npermalink: /Riana\u0026rsquo;s_Body/ "

She tends to dress simply but smartly and does her best not to draw attention to the fact that she is considerably wealthy, both by inheritance and from her practice.\nGeneral Description She is a caring individual who has been drawn into a pretty bad place in her life by circumstances and a series of unfortunate \u0026lsquo;wrong place, wrong time\u0026rsquo; events. She does her best to persevere and help what people she can with her skills, and her fortune, while she ponders ways to extricate herself from her situation. Sam is kind, sensitive, quiet, and reserved, which are traits that have likely served to keep her alive under the circumstances of her life thus far.\nSkills of Note Equipment of Note History Sam grew up priveledged, but never let it show. She worked diligently at her studies and graduated top of her class in the medical fields of human biology and cybernetic medicine. She had a burning deisre to help people who had been hurt in accidents and needed reconstruction but were unable to afford genetically created bio-systems. She pressed herself into service as a sort of miracle worker, performing body reconstructin and rebuilding to the less fortunate souls of Neo-Tokyo, where she quickly established a reputation as an extremely competent doctor who never asked questions.\nUnfortunately, this reputation saw a trickle of much less savory people coming through her clinic doors. A trickle which quickly turned into a stream, then a constant flow, and before she knew it, she had become the go-to doctor for the criminal element of Earth Ring Station. This is a position that she neither wants, nor intends to keep, but she can not find a way to get herself clear without attaching a huge price to her head. As long as she stays where she is and keeps quiet, she is able to live quite comfortable, and still help out the occasional, innocent, underprivelledge person in need that comes through her door. The mob might not be filled with the most savory characters, but they certainly pay well. Money she can turn around and pour into her humanatarian efforts.\nShe walks a difficult, extremely thin line, but she is learning to live with it by the time Alina falls into her life and sets things to spinning in a very unfamiliar direction.\nSpoilers Status: Living\nCategory:People_Future\u0026mdash; title: Samantha Cobb\npermalink: /Samantha_Cobb/ "

The Saturn community’s primary export is noble gasses such as xenon and argon which are used as fuel in Ion drive systems that are one of the mainstays of intrasystem transportation.\nRecently, several start-up companies have begun trying to build an ancillary ship yard in Saturn space in an attempt to reduce the cost of starship construction, a large portion of which is due to hauling and processing of raw materials. Thus far they have set up materials processing facilities in orbit around the planet itself and are dedicating those facilities’ output to the construction of their ship yards. The conglomerate has thus far kept their hands out of this new business, preferring to watch and see what happens. As long as the money keeps flowing out of the system they don’t much care what goes on there, unless it becomes a problem in some way. There is one primary space station in orbit around Saturn where all shipments are collated together and inventoried before they are shipped back to Earth.

It was forged by an ancient elven smith and has been passed down through his family for centuries. The weapon is a small shaft of about 4 feet in length that is capped on either end by a straight, narrow blade, each about 2 feet in length. The weapon is a powerful magical item that allows its wielder to parry or block magical bolts and other similar attacks, harmlessly dissipating them into the air around the weapon. However, the wielder needs to still have the skill and speed to get the weapon between themselves and the attack before this will work and as such this weapon is really only fully useful in the hands of someone with supernatural speed and reflexes. An additional capability of the weapon is its ability to be split in half a the center of the handle, making it into two short swords with longer than usual handles that allow the wielder to better handle multiple attackers or make multiple attacks themselves. This weapon is attuned to its wielder in a ceremony of inheritance that, once completed makes it so only the person to which it is attuned is able to hold the weapon. If anyone else touches it they will be dealt a severe blow to the heart that will kill most people outright. Anyone who survives the magical attack and holds on to the weapon will be dealt another blow, and another, continuing until they either die, or drop the weapon. Because of this, Jumah is extremely aware of where the weapon is at all times and will be instantly set on edge by anyone even looking at the weapon as if they might want to touch it. Selendria\u0026rsquo;s keen, magical blades will cut through just about any material that is not magically fortified or enhanced, including mundane weapons of event he highest quality and best craftsmanship.\nCategory:Weapons_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Selendria\npermalink: /Selendria/ "

The area is almost always covered in snow, although it does clear up a bit in the summer months. Snow storms are frequent but not constant and the region has several well maintained roads leading from Talanor to Rathalon and the surrounding areas, although if a traveler leaves the safety of the patrolled roads they are likely to run into some of the orcs that live in the numerous ruins and fallen structures of the area. There are a few families that live in homes near Rathalon where the guards can help keep their fields and livestock pens clear of orcs and other predators. The area is large, broad and largely flat and easy to traverse terrain.\nThe Southern Wastes is a sub-arctic region that stretches from Rathalon\u0026rsquo;s Northern gate northward and westward to the Gelid Mountains on two sides. Along the northern border lay the foot of Mount Tellamon and the southern entrance to the subterranean city of Talanor. The eastern border of the Southern Wastes slowly transitions the environment back into a more temperate climate with regular seasonal changes where most of Rathalon\u0026rsquo;s farm land is laid out. Along the southeast boarder of the Southern Wastes stands the massive Lich King\u0026rsquo;s Gate, doorway to the dark side of Kalijor.\nFeatures/Places of Note Most of the Southern Wastes is a barren, inhospitable, frosty land that is constantly covered in snow and ice and frequented by long, frigid, snow storms. Every once in a while the snow will get bad enough that visibility is reduced to near zero and temperatures drop well below the threshold of most sentient\u0026rsquo;s tolerance.\nThe Southern Wastes play host to numerous tribes of orcs, many of which live in the colder areas in the ruins of old human buildings and settlements. Some tribes live in the lightly forested areas of the more temperate southern portion of the area but all of the orcs are a menace to travelers, striking from the shadows or depths of a blizzard to take what they want and fade away again.\nA few families live along the southern edge of the Southern Wastes, where they are within a stone\u0026rsquo;s throw of the defensive wall that surrounds Rathalon and guards are not too far away from them if they need assistance.\nThe farm lands to the southeast are well patrolled by the Rathalon Guard as it is the primary source of Rathalon\u0026rsquo;s agriculture and livestock.\nGovernment History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Southern Wastes\npermalink: /Southern_Wastes/ "

Space travel is still not tightly regulated in open space, although flying in or near an inhabited body (Meaning planet, moon, asteroid, space station, etc) requires a pilot’s license and all of the appropriate clearances from ground control for the air-space in question.\nThere are a myriad of different types and designs of space craft available, ranging from sleek, sexy two-seaters to family size six to ten passenger ships, then up into cargo hauling and mobile home sized vessels. Typically anything larger than a yacht is owned and operated by a company for the purpose of cargo hauling or dignitary/VIP travel. There are giant passenger liners that haul passengers from point to point and even larger versions that are more like cruise ships, providing every amenity conceivable while they roam around space ponderously, allowing passengers plenty of time to relax and unwind while en route to wherever they are going.\nSpace ship technology has advanced by leaps and bounds in the last five hundred years, providing energy shields that are capable of repelling micro-meteorites and other such harmful space debris, Radiation dampening fields that block out all known forms of harmful radiation and cosmic rays, and super strong materials and construction techniques that have allowed vessels to be made smaller and lighter, but stronger than anything previously known.\nSpace craft hulls are armored enough to withstand bombardment by micro meteorites at sub-luminal speeds but not to withstand weapons fire of any significant force. Hulls designed for combat are used only in military grade vessels.\nWeapons systems are strictly controlled by the government and only the weakest weapons designed for self defense and destruction of space debris are allowed to be mounted on anything but military grade vessels.\nSensor systems are available in a wide variety ranging from standard RADAR type systems to radiation detectors, thermal sensors, Electro Magnetic field sensors, motion sensors, collision detection and a myriad of others. New sensor systems become available every day that add a host of new capabilities to what is already in use and to date none of them have become ‘controlled’ systems by the government.\nPropulsion systems fall into two categories, sub-luminal or slower than light, and super-luminal or faster than light. Not long ago, super-luminal travel was a pipe dream, requiring long distance journeys to be made in stasis as they required years or even decades to complete, but even cryo-ships were a step forward from the generation ships that were used to initially colonize Sol’s closest neighboring star systems.\nCategory:Technology\u0026mdash; title: Spacecraft Technology\npermalink: /Spacecraft_Technology/ "

It is a city that is carved out of the belly of Mount Telemon to the north of Rathalon, between the snowy Northern and Southern Wastes. The city maintains a constant level of lighting and temperature day and night, year round which makes it uncomfortable for most surface-dwelling people to handle on a continuous basis. Talanor is home to some of Kalijor\u0026rsquo;s most highly celebrated craftsmen across several disciplines, blacksmithing, jewelry crafting, tattooing, piercing, and invention/innovation. The city houses hundreds of thousands of long-term citizens as well as thousands of transients on any given day and is the gateway into the old mines where the ancient Dwarven city of Kal’ek T’nal, long abandoned since the great war.\nTalanor is the subterranean city located within Mt. Tellamon far to the north of Rathalon, across the frosty Southern Wastes.\nTalanor is a large city, playing home to nearly a million sentients, mostly dwarves and gnomes. It is the home of most of Kalijor\u0026rsquo;s best craftsmen, especially in the fields of metallurgy and geology.\nFeatures/Places of Note The construction techniques of Talanor vary but most structures are made from stone and other forms of masonry, most of which has been excavated from the local mines that open into the city along its periphery. The city is housed mostly within one central chamber that is massive in scale, with its ceiling high enough that it is out of sight of most races, disappearing into the darkness and haze that blankets the top of the cavern.\nMajor features of the city include the forge, the arena, and the dojo.\nThe forge is a massive building housing hundreds of forges and foundries. This is the place to go if you are looking for any blacksmithed equipment, most of which is of exceptional quality as the forge is operated by some of the best dwarven and gnomish smiths in Kalijor.\nThe arena is one of the largest public arenas in Kalijor. Its bouts are famous for being fairly officiated and well documented.\nThe dojo is a large structure with one large, central room and numerous outlying rooms, each of which is set up as a training facility for martial artists. The dojo is renowned throughout Kalijor as the premier training location for martial artists and is home to some of the most highly regarded masters alive today.\nThere is a small portal chamber in Talanor connecting it to Rathalon through the Kalijor portal network.\nGovernment Government in Talanor is almost nonexistent. The city is governed by a confederation of craftsmen that make policy decisions through debate over drinks in local taverns.\nThere is a local militia that is peopled by the instructors from the dojo who take rotating shifts as guards at the main gates and other populace locations such as the market and the arena.\nHistory Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Talanor\npermalink: /Talanor/ "

	"content": " Technical Information Full Name: The Astraeus Accord Aliases: The Accord, The Pact, The Astraeus Act, and \u0026lsquo;dammit, that.\u0026rsquo; Date Established: December 21, 2721 Affected Parties: All Conglomerate Citizens, all citizens of \u0026lsquo;the Dregs\u0026rsquo;\nGeneral Description The Astraeus Accord outlines the relationship between The Conglomerate and the dregs. The accord details political roles and responsabilities of both parties as well as social and economical concerns and relationships.\nUnder the Astraeus Accord, it is unlawful for any member of either party to engage in open fighting in any public location. Dissidents are afforded basic human rights by the accord, meaning they cannot be simply disregarded by Conglomerate citizens. This means that no dissident individual (Dissident being defined within the accord as a non-citizen of the Conglomerate) can be denied assistance when truly warranted, and cannot be openly harrassed, or their property taken or harmed without due cause.\nAdditionally, They Astraeus Accord outlines trade agreements and provides the ability for a limited number of dissidents to apply for and acquire Conglomerate citizenship, although it does severely limit the social and political heights to which these individuals can climb within the Conglomerate. This ability to maintain dual citizenship creates a conduit through which trade can be orchistrated to keep both parties supplied with any unique goods and/or technologies that they cannot otherwise acquire, or are unwilling to produce on their own.\nCaveats First and foremost, the terms and conditions, indeed the very existance of teh Astraeus Accord are kept secret from the general populace and citizens of the Conglomerate. Almost all Dissidents know of the accord and what it does for them, but the Conglomerate does not want its citizens knowing that they are suffering the pressence of another political party in the Sol system.\nThe accord uses such loose terminology in some places, particularly in the rules and guidelines concerning interaction between Conglomerate and dissident peoples, that harrassment, theft, and general disreputable treatment of dissident people is still easily overlooked. Conglomerate forces are given tremendous leeway in how they interact with dissidents and all but the most grevious offenses are quickly swept under the proverbial rug.\nDissident currency (citizens of the Dregs use semi-precious metals formed into standard-sized ingots as hard currency) is not considered legal tender in any Conglomerate facility.\nConglomerate currency (digital credits managed by a centralized computer banking network and tied to citizen accounts by their biometric near field ID implant) is not able to be used in dissident facilities as they are \u0026lsquo;off the grid\u0026rsquo; by design. Person-toperson transactions are still possible and will be updated as soon as one of the involved parties reenters a Conglomerate facility or vessel.\nIn a strange peculiarity, due to the digital nature of the Conglomerate\u0026rsquo;s currency, the only place where a currency exchange can be effectively made, is in a Conglomerate facility or registered vessel. This is typically done via black or grey market transactions or illegal currency brokers, who charge an unreasonable percentage for their services.\nThose who apply for and are granted dual citizenship, are never allowed to hold jobs within Conglomerate facilities or vessels. These individuals are treated as pariahs by official Conglomerate citizens who know or discover their identities (with a few exceptions, of course). Further, if these individuals make one transgression, break one law, or even miss a payment on any goods, services, or rented space, they can be severely fined at best, or have their Conglomerate citizenship revoked and any assets confiscated at worst. They are not legally allowed to be executed for such an offense, although the accord does allow for dissidents to be legally harmed or killed during the commission of a crime, so it is a fine line that is easy for Conglomerate personnel to cross and difficult for those few brave dissident souls who try, to walk.\nHistory In the wake of the Battle of Titan, tempers were hot and there was little desire from either side to truly make ammends or work together. It took more than six months of bickering and fillabustering to arrive at a document that could get anywhere close to being approved by both sides. The Conglomerate worked diligently at keeping verbiage loose enough to give themselves enourmous leeway and opportunity for interpruitation of the accord. Particularly in how dissident people and their property were able to be dealt with.\nIn the end, it was threats of witholding new technologies and expensive resources by the dissidents that finally brought the Conglomerate around on a few key points. In particular the ability to trade with and maintain citizenship in Conglomerate facilities.\nSigned on December 21, 2721 after The Battle of Titan.\nSignatories include all five CEOs of the Conglomerate at the time, and the heads of the ten largest households of the Dregs at the time.\nSpoilers "

Before long, the dissidents had banded together to form larger communities and, eventually, an entire new \u0026lsquo;city\u0026rsquo; of sorts took shape in teh form of several asteroids that had been tunneled through, strapped together and turned into a clandestine mega-city of its own.\nStill, it was only a matter of time before they were noticed. The dissidents\u0026rsquo; need to fend for themselves caused them to develop many new technologies that the Conglomerate had no need to create, but could find many uses for. Additionally, the dissidents\u0026rsquo; manufacturing facilities and resource collection methods allowed them efficiencies that the Conglomerate could not replicate even with robotic labor forces and their best minds on teh problems. This created an unsteady symbiotic relationship between the two parties where the Conglomerate would allow a certain amount of goods to be smuggled out of their facilities in exchange for deliveries of raw materials, new technologies, and sub-components that they could produce themselves as efficiently as the dissidents did.\nHowever, being a dissident meant a person had no rights, or standing. Essentially they were non-entities and could be treated with compete disregard by Conglomerate citizens. It was the military, in particular, that took special advantage of this fact. Using it to harry dissident ships and facilities, steal goods, hurt and take advantage of people, and generally do and take whatever they wanted.\nOver time, the dissidents began to fight back. It was mostly just a few outspoken individuals who took matters into their own hands, turning to piracy and preying upon Conglomerate ships, returning in kind the same treatments they had been given. This caused immidiate excallation by Conglomerate forces and before long, there were open skirmishes happening all over the Sol system. As tensions mounted and hostilities showed no signs of lessening, dissident guerrillas began organizing into true fighting forces, seeking out and attacking Conglomerate military vessels, ambushing civilian transports and cargo vessels and even, occasionally, turning their ire upon civilian population centers.\nEventually, the only possible outcome of all of these activities came to pass. A Conglomerate military patrol came across a dissident gas mining operation on Titan and set about harrassing and threatening them. The dissidents made a call for help and one of the larger and more organized dissident fighting forces happened to be in Saturn orbit to receive the panicked shout. Within an hour, the dissidents were on top of the Conglomerate forces, who also called for help, drawing in all nearby military forces. Less than a day later, a full scale war had broken out, with forces pouring in from all over the system to bolster both sides with regular reinforcements.\nThe Battle of Titan raged for several days before the fighting slowed to a crawl, then petered out entirely. All told, more than 250,000 souls were consumed in that blaze of hatred and it left both sides forever scarred, but finally willing to come to more formal diplomatic relations with the establishment of The Astraeus Accord.\nInterestingly enough, whenever hostilities break our between Conglomerate and Dissident forces, even to this day, both sides use the battle cry, \u0026ldquo;remember Titan.\u0026rdquo;\n"

	"content": "Early in the year 2800, a series of gang wars broke out in Neo-Tokyo shortly after the Conglomerate withdrew from the city to consolidate power and provide an environment in which they could encourage the growth of a healthy black market. These rival gangs and factions all fought for control of the city and its underworld community. They fought in the alleys and on teh rooftops until their fighting spilled over onto the streets and required the Conglomerate to step in.\nInitial responses by Conglomerate forces were met with heavy resistence, prompting a growing war of escallating responses. The more troops the Conglomerate sent in, the more they polarized the various gangs and organizations in the city, unifying them into one agressive group with one powerful ally. While Conglomerate reporting made this activity out to be deplorable and to be condemmed and put down, it was secretly what they had been after all along. Because it was easier for them to police and control one organization than it would be a hundred.\nAfter months of open fighting and skirmishes in the streets, all time in which teh Conglomerate was clandestinely coercing their opponents to come together, they closed the trap by sending in a massive fighting force that rolled over their enemies, laying waste to huge portions of the city and killing tens of thousands of people, some enemies, some civilians. Of course, behind the scenes this was a series of calculated acts designed to unite their opponents and galvanize their citizens, creating a situation that was much more tennable in the long term.\nAfter the Blitz, the criminal elements in Neo-Tokyo regrew as a single, loose-knit organization with several people that had been members of the former, individual gangs and organizations coming together to run the new crime scene in Neo-Tokyo as a sort of crime family. Since then, the COnglomerate has left a much larger and better trained group of soldiers on duty in the city to keep things civil, but they still turn a blind eye to much of the criminal activity that occurs there in order to foster the network that allows trade goods to flow in and out of the city, acting as a conduit between the Conglomerate, and the Dissidents of the Dregs.\n"

	"content": "A corporate government is an interesting prospect at best. The government of the future is formed by an elaborate interweaving of the top-level management from various corporations with extreme, and far-reaching influence. In short, the more powerful a particular corporation is, the more influential they are in the political landscape of humanity.\nJust as any corporation\u0026rsquo;s leadership is made up of multiple levels or layers of people, each holding more power or sway than those immediately below them, the Sol system\u0026rsquo;s government is made up of the CEO\u0026rsquo;s of multiple corporations, the more powerful the corporation is, the higher up the chain of command the individual is.\nPolicy is decided from the top down, with the highest-level individual handing orders down to the next level for execution, and expecting follow-through that can be verified through a complicated system of analysis and metrics. If an action is determined to be more hassle than it is worth, typically the individual responsible for its having been carried out is removed from whatever position of power they hold. As a result, just as in the corporate world of old, tasks and directives are typically handed down as far as possible, to be carried out by the peons at the base of the pyramid.\nEvery person that lives within the developed areas of the Sol system, in some way or other, work for the conglomerate. Even John Doe that runs the local grocery store, is responsible for corporate directives on some level. Everyone that is not a dissident, makes their living within the corporate infrastructure. Housing is provided by the corporation, free of charge. As is food, health care, efficient public transportation, power, data, media, all provided by the corporation.\nBecause of the structure of the government, it is a miserable place for anyone not of the proper mindset to live and work (At least, anyone seeking power to any degree, the people at the bottom of the pyramid are usually perfectly happy and blissfully unaware of any form of complexities in the government) in an environment that is rife with espionage and back-stabbing.\nCenturies ago, the government abandoned the idea of promotion based upon tenure and the \u0026lsquo;open door\u0026rsquo; policy. The only way to get ahead in the government is by moving someone else lower on the ladder. There is no necessity in moving up one step at a time however, if you can prove the incompetence of someone ten steps ahead of you, then you can try on their shoes, at least until the next eager go-getter comes along and dethrones you that is.\nThe corporation (that is to say, humanity) is ultimately governed by the Conglomerate, which is a group of five CEO\u0026rsquo;s of the five most powerful, most influential corporations in existence. It is widely rumored that the Conglomerate is actually ruled by a single, enigmatic individual that lives in the shadows and is never seen or heard directly by anyone, at least not anyone who knows what they may have seen at any rate.\nEach of the five CEO\u0026rsquo;s has the power and resources of their own corporation behind them, and they all tend to constantly be vying for power of the others. As a result they have each developed a private armada of ships and an army of troops that do their bidding. Publicly these forces all appear as one unified fighting force, and it is true in as much as whenever there is any kind of threat that faces the conglomerate as a whole, they will work together with great efficiency to fix the problem. However, when things are calmer, there is a great deal of tension between these forces whenever they encounter one another. They will constantly work against one another by establishing regular areas of influence where they enforce the will of their own corporation, but they will also try to expand their sphere of influence by moving in on other corporation\u0026rsquo;s areas.\nThe end result for the citizens living within these areas can be subjected to constant changes in military presence and minutia of the law that they bring with them. People living in the center of any power\u0026rsquo;s turf are generally shielded from these effects, but those unfortunate enough to reside along the edges will usually know no peace from the effects of the struggle.\nEven with all of this political strife taken into account there is one thing that will pull all of the various entities within the corporation and the Conglomerate together, and that is dissidents. Dissidents are those people who choose to live \u0026lsquo;off the grid.\u0026rsquo; They refuse to work for the corporation. They refuse to live within corporate facilities or benefit from their other offerings. Any time a pocket of dissidents is located, they are routed out by corporate forces and its people are \u0026lsquo;reeducated\u0026rsquo; and reintroduced to life in a \u0026lsquo;civilized\u0026rsquo; society. Those that resist this process are\u0026hellip; misplaced\u0026hellip; and usually never seen or heard from again.\nThere is an underground movement among the dissidents, and some of the citizens of the corporation. The movement is meant to unseat the conglomerate and establish a republic in its place, and it is, of course, resisted with the utmost ferocity by the Conglomerate. This is why the dissidents are rooted out and annihilated whenever they are discovered.\nThe five corporations that make up the Conglomerate are\n Quark Industries Aegis Online T.R.I.P.

It is an extremely simple, circular design with very strong armor, weak shields, and moderate defensive weapons. The interior design consists of a single, circular hallway that runs through the ship, with quarters, living areas, the bridge, and the engine room all located on the outside of the ring, against the outer hull, and the mid-sized cargo hold nestled in the center, toward the bottom of the vessel. Cargo is loaded and off-loaded via a circular pad that descends from the bottom of the ship, and makes up the entire floor of the cargo hold, which allows extremely easy access to the entire space for purposes of loading, unloading, and sorting cargo.\nThe ship is not only extremely old, but it is showing its age. Tor does little to keep the vessel in good condition, only spending money on it when something is broken. He does not clean any of the interior spaces, making the entire habitable area look like a garbage dump, and smell like one too. The only exception to this is the cockpit, which he routinely upgrades with the best controls and acoutriments available. It is little wonder then, that he spends most of his time in his extremely comfortable, extremely expensive, captain\u0026rsquo;s chair.\nSensor Systems of Note Defensive Systems of Note Offensive Systems of Note Rail Guns Missiles\nSpecial Features of Note The ship\u0026rsquo;s old design means there are lots of little (and some large) nooks and crannies that can be used to stash away any less-than-legal cargo he might be hauling.\nHistory Spoilers Status: In Service\nCategory:Vehicles\u0026mdash; title: The End\npermalink: /The_End/ "

	"content": " A brief History of Humanity\u0026rsquo;s Rise Sometime in the late twenty first century, circa 2090, the human race took its first tentative steps off of their home world and began living in space. Their first off-world colonies were in space stations that hung in orbit around the Earth and her moon, Luna. Over the next three-hundred years they continued to branch out and expand across the solar system. New developments in propulsion technology made intra-system travel more like daily commutes, allowing people to travel between the Earth and Luna in a few of hours, and out to more distant planets in a matter of days.\nAs humanity expanded outward the economy that drove it also grew into a robust commerce between worlds and as commerce grew, so too did the need to have a central hub or distribution outlet for goods. Since Earth was the most likely location, as well as being the most populace world in the Sol System, it was decided to build a massive space station in Earth’s local space to become that hub. It took nearly one-hundred years to complete the massive project, although it began fulfilling its intended role some ten years after construction began, increasing capacity as construction continued.\nOnce completed, the Earth Ring Station became the seat of power in the solar system. The ring was administered by a conglomerate of mega-corporations that had jointly financed the project when the Earth governments had refused to do so. As commerce in the system began making this Conglomerate astronomical amounts of money they hatched a scheme to wrest power away from the political bodies that still quibbled back and forth on the planet’s surface.\nAfter nearly fifty years of planning and gathering resources, the Conglomerate proceeded to buy up all of the debt that the nations of the Earth had accrued over centuries of financial mismanagement. They then gave the governments in question –namely the super-power nations, The United States, China, Japan, Russia, The United Kingdom, etc.— ninety days to repay their outstanding debts. When none of the governments repaid their debts, the conglomerate foreclosed on all of them and took possession of the majority of the countries. Shortly after, they began a political restructuring, carving up the globe and putting their own figure-heads in charge of the puppet show that world politics had become.\nSlowly they then began to take financial control of the smaller countries, beginning with the third-world and then sweeping through Europe. While most countries began to experience unprecedented progress and unheard of monetary gains across all industries, there were those elements that resented what had been done and fought for every scrap they could take.\nEventually the dissidents struck a major blow, to themselves as well as the Conglomerate, when they hacked into the strategic defense systems and initiated a global mass-destruction, in an attempt to destroy the seats of power that the Conglomerate’s figureheads occupied. In the devastation, more than eighty percent of the Earth’s surface was rendered uninhabitable and billions of people were killed.\nIn true entrepreneurial style, the Conglomerate used this event to illustrate the dangers of partisan political rule and convinced the remainder of the human race that a system of corporate governance was in fact a better way to proceed. Shortly, the Conglomerate had seated itself on top of a vast, complex corporate landscape that governed the human race as though it were one massive corporation.\nThe Conglomerate quickly built a large fighting force of ships and soldiers in order to quell any form of resistance or fledgling political parties that may have risen up against them.\nOver the next five-hundred years the Human race prospered, although not everyone was happy about it. The benefits of corporate rule were many, especially in the areas of technology and medicine. The average life-span increased to nearly two-hundred years and space travel continually became cheaper and faster. Fewer wars –public wars at least— were fought and those that were, were ended almost before they began due to swift intervention from the Conglomerate fighting force and their superior technology.\nToday the Conglomerate is presided over by five executive officers that use a simple majority vote system to determine policy. Beneath these executives is an elaborate network of subordinates that support their higher-ups dutifully in hopes of one day getting the big promotion into upper management. All businesses in some way report to someone within the structure of the Conglomerate and all profits are absorbed into the non-stop machine that is the government of the human race.\nAnyone who draws a pay check inevitably gets their money from the Conglomerate, even if it is through back channels or black market connections. Health care is free to anyone that is a registered citizen of the Conglomerate, as is housing and all other essentials of life, food, entertainment, basic supplies and so on, all provided free of charge simply for being a citizen of the Conglomerate. Most people are either unaware or choose to ignore the fact that the Conglomerate reserves the right to eavesdrop on conversations, communications, and exchanges throughout the Sol System in order to keep tabs on the workings of their empire.\nThere is a group of secret police that enforce company by-laws and bring to justice those that break said by-laws. Justice is usually swift and extreme, although hardly ever public.\nThe year as of the beginning of the story is approximately 3040 AD.\nTimeline 2011 - The United States Government ceases funding of active space activities in favor of spending money on research and licensing developments out to third parties.\n2017 - Russia and China follow the example set by the United States and cease all active space vehicle operations. All major world governments now rely completely on corporate facilities to get in and out of orbit.\n2020 - Cold Fusion establishes dominance in space vehicle propulsion and power systems technology, becoming the first corporation to launch a craft from Earth, orbit the moon, and return safely, without government funding, and in under 12 hours total time from launch to landing. This landmark is also the first time this is accomplished with 100% reusable spacecraft components, demonstrated by the same equipment making the same journey in eleven hours, a mere 18 hours after the original flight touches down on Earth.\n2025 - Mobius Industries establishes first permanently inhabited facility on Luna.\n2050 - Of the fifteen colonies on Luna\u0026rsquo;s surface, the largest is now 40,000 citizens strong. Cold Fusion becomes the first to orbit Mars with manned craft, a trip taking less than three months using their latest generation Ion drive.\n2075 - First space stations at Mars and Venus are officially brought on-line and begin operations. Colonies established on Mars and its moons now have populations in the thousands.\n2100 - Construction of the Earth Ring Station begins with the orbital elevator over Asia Minor. The orbital city surrounding this elevator is dubbed Neo-Tokyo.\n2130 - First successful full-body cybernetic prosthetic is heralded as the dawn of the immortal human. Quark Industries is lauded as the science of cybernetics is launched into the next century.\n2135 - T.R.I.P., a previously major player in the pharmacutical industry makes the leap into medical technology with high-resolution DNA scanner that can, for the first time, generate an accurate image of an individual based upon a DNA scan from a single cell of their body.\n2150 - Aegis Online makes the move from simple game and software developer, to hardware and interface technology company, marked by the very first use of an Encepholographic Induction Harness to fully override the brain\u0026rsquo;s I/O carrier signals and immerse a person in a fully virtual, sensory-rich world.\n2155 - Cybernetic reconstruction becomes so cost effective and common place that legislation is passed to handle the registration of alterations so that people\u0026rsquo;s identities are not lost, and so that their capabilities are known to the authorities. A new \u0026lsquo;class\u0026rsquo; system is instituted whereby people with more than 25% of their bodies replaced with artificial components are dubbed \u0026lsquo;Tech-Line\u0026rsquo;.\n2170 - T.R.I.P.\u0026rsquo;s continued genetic tinkering produces the human race\u0026rsquo;s first batch of psychics, most of whom promptly disappear into the general population and begin inter-breeding with \u0026lsquo;Base-Line\u0026rsquo; humans.\n2200 - Final construction of Earth Ring Station is completed as the sixth orbital elevator goes online. All five corporations that will eventually make up The Conglomerate unofficially move their headquarters from earth to the Earth Ring Station. Off-Earth population officially crests one billion people for the first time.\n2250 - Propulsion systems have developed to the point that the first Arc Ships are launched, sending manned craft outside our solar system for the first time. T.R.I.P. successfully rewrites a person\u0026rsquo;s DNA and the human race watches on television as \u0026lsquo;Mary\u0026rsquo; changes, in a matter of months, to reflect her new DNA.\n2300 - Venus Station officially becomes the most populace facility outside of Earth\u0026rsquo;s local space. The station has been under constant expansion/construction since its inception. For the first time, more than 99% of a person\u0026rsquo;s DNA is rewritten, by a computer, and their body changes to fit the new program in a mere six weeks, emerging healthy, happy, and espousing the change, saying they are finally who they felt they were always meant to be. New companies begin to crop up, offering on the spot genetic modifications of hair and other cosmetic features. The \u0026lsquo;Gene-Line\u0026rsquo; classification is added to the human classification system.\n2400 - The world\u0026rsquo;s governments begin to stumble through economic hard times as the major powers begin to deal with the effects of mass exodus to off-world facilities and new Arc Ships. Debt figures skyrocket and public opinion polls show confidence in world leaders plummeting. Psionics begin to appear in a measurable number of the Sol System\u0026rsquo;s population, and classifications for their abilities are defined, as is a system of registrations, and the addition of the term \u0026lsquo;Psi-Line\u0026rsquo; to the human classification system.\n2450 - The Conglomerate, now an official organization, initiates a buy-out of all major countrys\u0026rsquo; debt, and the banks that shoulder it.\n2465 - The final political resistance is swept aside as the population of the world votes the final non-corporate political officer out of office.\n2470 - The world economy is due for a complete recovery in the next 5 years as salaries soar and contentment surveys show the human race has nver been happier. The Conglomerate initiates buy-outs of the world\u0026rsquo;s third-world countries, bringing their populations \u0026lsquo;into the light\u0026rsquo; almost overnight.\n2475 - Conglomerate take-over of Europe and Asia Minor begins. Population of the Sol System crests 25 billion people.\n2480 - Dissident protestors begin system-wide rallies against corporate rule as the corporate takeover of Europe is completed and the human race is officially subsumed by a corporate rule.\n2499 - Dissidents successfully hack into the old United States and Russian defense networks and launch what they describe as a \u0026lsquo;preemptive strike\u0026rsquo; upon the major world capitols, intending to destroy the seats of corporate rule and take the world back for its citizens.\n2500 - More than 80% of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s surface is devastated by the dissident attack. More than twelve billion lives are lost between Earth\u0026rsquo;s destruction and fighting across the Sol System. The Conglomerate is officially embraced by a nearly unanimous vote of all respondants throughout the Sol System.\n2501 - A small company called Solidarity Online opens its doors. The company developes and hosts a variety of Massively Multipleyer Online games, all played through a sub-space link that enables real-time communication and interaction across vast, interstellar distances. Sub-Space technology was previously only available for applications such as data links between massive space stations, planets, and the Arc Ships moving ponderously between stars. The most popular MMO offered by the company is the stand-out fantasy game called kalijor.\n2510 - The last of the Earth\u0026rsquo;s population is officially evacuated and all six orbital elevators are closed down and sealed off. The Earth is classified as uninhabitable.\n2515 - Repeated attempts at landing on the surface ot the Earth, and the resources, and lives, used up in their constant rescue causes the Conglomerate to completely close the planet and set up a defense grid on the Earth Ring Station that shoots down any and all craft attempting to land on the planet. Better to sacrifice just the perpitrators than them and their rescuers as well.\n2540 - Rampant, unliscensed cybernetic and genetic manipulation begins to become a problem. New laws are laid down, mandating the evaluation/licensing of every person in every Conglomerate facility in the system. Those who refuse to submit, or are away from official facilities and fail to receive word/arrive in time to be \u0026lsquo;counted\u0026rsquo; are labeled as dissidents and all rights and privelages of Conglomerate citizenship are officially revoked. This event later becomes known as \u0026lsquo;The Purge\u0026rsquo; and is seen as the first truly tyrannacle action taken by the Conglomerate.\n2600 - Human population officially rises above fifteen billion for the first time since the destruction of the Earth.\n2605 - Artificial gravity and faster than light drive systems are given their first trial runs. Within a decade, \u0026lsquo;gravity levelers\u0026rsquo; are installed in all planetary and orbital Conglomerate facilities and \u0026lsquo;standard\u0026rsquo; gravity is established as a measurement baseline with lower-gravity environments \u0026lsquo;leveled off\u0026rsquo; to Standard, and higher gravity environments labeled as some factor of Standard (i.e.: 1.25 times Standard, 2 times Standard, etc.).\n2640 - A fleet of ships bearing new super-luminal drives is launched with parts and components necessary to retrofit the now-ancient Arc Ships with super-luminal drive systems in order to speed them on the way to their final destinations.\n2650 - The Kalijor game server reaches a human population of one billion people, with more than 750 million online at any given time.\n2665 - First documented appearance of a Nuiri-Qatnio, a massively altered genetic and psionic abberation brought on by the interbreeding of a heavily modified Gene-Line and extremely powerful Psi-Line human. This unfortunate creature dies before its third birthday but sets a benchmark for over-modification of the human genome that causes legislation to be set in place outlawing the inter-breeding of registered Psi-Lines with Gene-Lines. The human race officially becomes five separate species.\n2671 - The Dregs becomes the official name for the settlements in the Asteroid belt where there is a growing population of unregisterd and dissident individuals, now collectively known as dissidents.\n2688 - Conglomerate incursions into The Dregs begin and the local population is harried by corporate forces.\n2693 - Corporate harrassment of Dissidents is officially sanctioned by the Conglomerate and small to medium skirmishes begin to break out all over the Sol System, particularly in and around the Asteroid Belt.\n2701 - After years of light fighting and bullying by the Conglomerate, the Dissidents of The Dregs finally proclaim in one voice that they have had enough and begin fighting openly with Conglomerate forces. Battlefields are purposfully chosen by Dissidents in order to keep the fighting off of their own turf and to create visibility to Conglomerate citizens where corporate propaganda cannot completely cover it up.\n2710 - The Conglomerate\u0026rsquo;s efforts to cast Dissidents in a bad light continue, as does the fighting. The Conglomerate is assured of an eventual victory even if by sheer attrition. While Conglomerate technology is largely superior, the Dissident fighters continue to surprise them with the occasional victory brought on by unknown technology.\n2720 - The Battle of Titan takes place, during which more than 250,000 people are killed on both sides of the conflict. The Dissidents manage to disable or distroy a startling number of Conglomerate vessels using smaller, faster, and extremely tough craft of unknown design, while suffering comparatively few losses of their own.\n2721 - The Astraeus Accord is signed into action, bringing an end to nearly 30 years of conflict between the Dissidents and the Conglomerate.\n2725 - The long-standing rivalry between Aegis Online and Solidarity Online (a grudge held by and acted upon solely by Aegis Online) begins to heat up as Aegis Online Digerati regularly try to break through Solidarity Online\u0026rsquo;s firewalls and whittle away the confidence of their user base. In response, Solidarity Online opens a small new division focused exclusively on the aquisition and deployment of new technology to enhance and protect their systems. This unnamed division\u0026rsquo;s field operatives, while never officially acknowledged, quickly become known as Pinchers and establish a reputation for being able to get into any facility or system and extract top secret hardware and data.\n2730 - A new age of corporate warfare begins as most corporations adopt similar practices to Solidarity Online and begin almost openly preying on one another. What once was a shadow war of unsanctioned and constantly denied activity moves more into the light, becoming instead an open political battlefield where hostile actions are openly spoken of at the board room table and corporate strategy turns to battlefield tactics.\n2740 - Human population across all colonies both in the Sol System and around neighboring stars reaches twenty billion. Kalijor is officially named by the Conglomerate as the preferred medium through which long-distance interactions and transactions are to be made. Despite much grumbling and general anticipation, Solidarity Online is not made a member of the Conglomerate.\n2750 - Advances in technology have sub-space transceivers now able to be installed in craft as small as two-man shuttles, expanding the use of instantaneous communication to millions more people.\n2760 - For the first time in 250 years, the Kalijor world experiences an unscheduled outage. The outage lasts nearly eight hours and is attributed to a massive failure in both the primary and secondary sub-space arrays at the Solidarity Online facility on Venus Station.\n2761 - Solidarity Online successfully petitions to take over ownership of the L1 Earth-Luna Lagrange point and begins construction on The Tyconderoga.\n2766 - The Tyconderoga is completed and Solidarity Online officially moves all of its operations and staff aboard the brand new space station. Kalijor experiences not one single interruption of service during the transfer of facilities.\n2770 - Neo-Tokyo is unofficially abandoned by The Conglomerate, with nothing more than a token presence in the center of the city. Organized crime and the black market take over and establish a shaky understanding with the Conglomerate garrison there.\n2800 - Fighting breaks out in Neo-Tokyo as an attempt is made to overrun the Conglomerate garrison in the center of the city. The Conglomerate responds by sending thousands of heavily armed troops into the city to pacify the situation. Thousands of criminals and innocents are killed in the conflict, which becomes known as The Blitz. When all is said and done, the Conglomerate garrison is ten times the size as before, and much better equiped, but otherwise, the city is again left to the crime lords and black marketeers.\n3032 - Riana Thorindal is born in Kalijor at the same time as a power surge from a fusion power sub-station on Luna feeds back into the living quarters of Willhelmina Orlova\u0026rsquo;s family. The surge seems to cause Riana to gain early potential for sentience and Solidarity Online responds with the gift of a top of the line game pod for Willhelmina to log into Kalijor from. This gift is described as an apology for the feedback despite the fact that Solidarity Online could not have been directly responsible for the surge.\n3033 - Willhelmina Orlova\u0026rsquo;s family home is ravaged by a fire caused by a breakdown in environmental controls and a spark from lingering power sub-station defects from the previous year. The compartment fire kills Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s parents and brother, sparing Willhelmina only because she was in her game pod at the time of the fire. Willhelmina is later that year adopted as a ward of Solidarity Online and put to work in Kalijor, watching and helping Riana\u0026rsquo;s development into a sentient artificial inteligence.\n3040 - Riana Thorindal\u0026rsquo;s conscienceless is downloaded from the Kalijor game servers into a custom made cybernetic body in order to prevent the Kalijor game world from crashing as a result of her presence there.

The ship is capable of comfortably accommodating three people, but could handle as many as six if the need arose and comfort was not a concern.\nIt looks like a bird of prey, with a hooked nose just below the forward viewport and dramatically forward-swept wings that curve down from the top of the ship’s mid section. The ailerons spread out from the top of the tail section in a fan shape, helping to complete the bird of prey image that netted the vessel its name.

The ship does however, still have its military grade hull armor as to remove it would destroy the vessel entirely.\nVincent has spent a great deal of time and money upgrading the ship and has added, among other things, a pair of the fastest ion drive systems available on the market, particle shields that have been modified to within military specs for repelling weapon\u0026rsquo;s fire, incredibly advanced computer and sensory systems, and numerous weapons systems that push the borders of legality for a private citizen. The ship has a clean record and Vincent is not in the habit of trafficking in controlled materials, but he does like to be prepared and just loves tinkering with the ship whenever he has the time and money to do so.\nThe Serendipity is an intrasystem ship only, meaning it has no superluminal capabilities, although Vincent is currently stashing money away to buy a high-end traction drive for the vessel. Currently, its maximum velocity is around .54c or 1\u0026frasl;2 the speed of light which allows him to make extremely fast runs from planet to planet within the Sol system. It is important to note, however, that operating at such velocities consumes enormous quantities of fuel and energy, making such \u0026lsquo;sprints\u0026rsquo; very expensive. Because of this sprinting ability Vincent tends to receive a lot of priority business which makes him a comfortable living and a fairly well known captain in the Sol system.\nThe Serendipity has something of a cult following among other small shipping operators and has won the Sol intrasystem relay race four years running. A race which has pilots push their vessels from the Earth Station out between Mars and the Mars Station, through the asteroid belt, past Titan, then threading the rings of Saturn and dashing back into the inner solar system for a hard line to Mercury, around the sun and past Venus, returning to Earth Station as quickly as possible. The Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity regularly wins the race by the margin of at least a day, sometimes three.\nSensor Systems of Note Advanced combat tracking system with IFF and 16 target simultaneous tracking. Internal and external bio and radiation sensors. Surface-mapping system.\nDefensive Systems of Note Heavy ablative armor High-energy planar particle chielding\nOffensive Systems of Note 2 ventrally mounted heavy particle beam turrets 1 dorsally mounted heavy laser cannon turret 2 fusilage mounted medium range missile launchers\nSpecial Features of Note Several large hidden compartments with cloaking systems\nHistory Spoilers Status: In Service When I was in my teens, my dad bought a ski boat. It was this awesome, glowing white with sea foam green accents, 21 foot long aquatic machine. I loved it, and still do to this day. In point of fact, I love boats of all kinds. Anyway, we were kicking around ideas for the name of the boat, because all boats ~must~ have names. It\u0026rsquo;s maritime tradition. Anyway, we kicked names around for a bit and the one that people liked the most was Beginner\u0026rsquo;s Luck, but it was decided that we didn\u0026rsquo;t want it to sound like we\u0026rsquo;d won the lottery or something, so we translated it into Latin, thus, the Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity.\nWell, we ended up not using the name for the family boat, but I liked it so much that I hung onto it for a bunch of years and when I needed a name for Vincent\u0026rsquo;s ship, it seemed like a no-brainer to me.\nCategory:Vehicles\u0026mdash; title: The Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s Serendipity\npermalink: /The_Neophyte\u0026rsquo;s_Serendipity/ "

	"content": "As cybernetic and genetic technology advanced, the human race began a slow but stead divergence into multiple \u0026lsquo;post-human\u0026rsquo; groups. The pace of the technology and alterations steadily increased over the years, creating larger and larger numbers of psychics or Psi-Lines, genetically altered or Gene-Lines, and technologically altered or Tech-Line individuals. These changes, combined with a slow but general acceptance of \u0026lsquo;post-human\u0026rsquo; individuals continued widening the gulf between groups, but never truly allowed them to diverge into separate species.\nWhen T.R.I.P. televised the first total DNA reconstruction of \u0026lsquo;Mary\u0026rsquo; in 2250, it opened the floodgates for all manner of changes to the status quo. For the first time in history, people could biologically become whoever, or whatever, they wanted to be. From that point forward, the pace of the species divergence increased geometrically. Overnight there was an explosion of psychics, elves, dwarves, satyrs, and every other imaginable creature. For the most part, these changes were not detrimental to breeding but as people continued to go to extremes, some incompatibility began to creep into the genome, further copartmentalizing the sub-species of the human race.\nThis rampant alteration of genetics and use of cybernetic technology had another issue that, even more than diverging genetic pools, was causing real trouble for The Conglomerate; the loss or alteration of set identities. Using these technologies a person could, quite quickly, disappear. The ability to completely alter, or even discard, one\u0026rsquo;s identity and genetic markers created an increasingly anarchistic environment, making it difficult for law enforcement to do its job and for The Conglomerate to keep track of its citizenry.\nIn late 2540 the Conglomerate struck its first major, tyrranical blow to the people of the Sol System. In order to quash the continued disregard for law and order (as they saw it), The Conglomerate ordered all citizens to present themselves for DNA and Cybernetic evaluation and cataloging. New identities were established and documented for everyone, as well as the implantation of near field biometric microchips that allowed for the easy establishement of a person\u0026rsquo;s identity and capabilities. Expecting instant compliance with its demands, The Conglomerate used military force to enact the new requirements, pulling citizens from their homes and places of business for cataloging and leaving the window open for less than a month. Those who were not identified, scanned, and tagged in that timeframe were then branded as dissident traitors and treated as such, with all rights and privlidges of citizenship completely revoked.\nThis event,called The Purge by nearly everyone, caused the expulsion of millions of people from Conglomerate facilities. It took years for these individuals to eventually coalesce into a more or less cohesive population within the Asteroid Belt, eventually forming an actual community that came to be known as the Dregs.\nOnce The Purge was completed, the Conglomerate instituted a policy of zero tolerance for citizens who fail to immidiately report any genetic or cybernetic alterations, or the emergence of any form of undocumented psionic abilities. Failure to report and update personal records results in a minimum centence of permanent revocation of Conglomerate citizenship, or a maximum snetence of execution, depending upon the nature of the unreported alterations.\n"

It hangers at her private facility in Ceres and is maintained only by her. If Niko were ever forced to reveal that she actually had any special feelings for an object, it would be this ship, as it was the vessel that she used to bring Alina home to her after she escaped the clutches of Tor Rayean in Tranquility.\nThe Seraphim is an ultra-fast performance vessel that has been kitted out with a few ammenities, such as a small sleeping cabin and a functioning bathing tub. To compensate for these additions, and to increase her performance envelope, all other non-essentials have been trimmed out, including any and all weapon systems, armor, and combat shielding. She maintains strong navigational shields, an extremely advanced sensory suite, and top of the line avionics and RCS/maneuvering systems, making her an extremely nimble craft in nearly any environment. Added to that, is the fact that she is powered by two high-output plasma drives that are well above her weight class, and a set of JATO/RATO boosters (Jet/Rocket Assisted Take-Off) for escaping high-gravity wells, or for an extra burst of speed in a pinch.\nThe Seraphim, while certainly not the fastest ship around, is easily in the top 50, and can make the run from Earth to Luna, a trip that takes most vessels 5-6 hours, and sprinters such as The Kestrel, 3-4 hours, in just over an hour.\nWhile Niko tends to stay in and around Ceres with her obligations demanding much of her time, Alina uses The Seraphim to make her trips to and from runner facilities to secure business, maintain relationships with customers, and carve out new market share for their operations.\nSensor Systems of Note Defensive Systems of Note High-energy navigational shields.

The station is positioned in the L1 Lagrange Point between Earth and Luna, and has been the sole facility of the corporation since it was brought online.\nThe Tyconderoga is a top of the line facility that acts as both home, and work place for the majority of Solidarity Online\u0026rsquo;s employees and their immidiate families. There are a variety of off-site personnel, but most of them work from private residences as Solidarity Online does not officially own any property outside of this station.\nFacilities include a massive, fully equipped gym with a quarter mile track, several olympic size swimming pools, sparring rings, a multi-screen cinema, large open market area, and numerous five-star eateries. The top level of teh station is covered in a large, transparent, geodesic dome that allows an unprecidented view of the stars, Earth, and Luna, all at once. This Promenade deck is where the market and most of the restaraunts are located, with most of the other recreational facilities (gyms, theaters, etc.) located immidiately below this level. Under these facilities are the residential areas of the station, which include school/educational, and health care facilities for the station\u0026rsquo;s myriad residents.\nThe heart of the station, well away from any external bulkheads, or access, is the \u0026lsquo;game deck\u0026rsquo;. This is where all of teh computers that operate Solidarity Online\u0026rsquo;s various MMO games are located. Almost 80% of teh power consumed on the station is used on these levels, yet less than 10% of employees ever see behind the thickly armored doors that keep these systems secure. Below the \u0026lsquo;game deck\u0026rsquo; are teh various other computer operations of the coorporation, security, finance, development, and the like. Below that are the operational levels where most of the power generation and environmental systems are located, as well as the loading, unloading, and storage of cargo and supplies. The lowest levels house the administrative operations, and the bottom-most point of the station is another, much smaller geodesic dome that houses teh office of Xavier Quinn, the corporation\u0026rsquo;s CEO.\nLike most space stations, the Tyconderoga is a large, self-contained city all unto itself, and even generates/grows most of its own vegetables, herbs, and a large amount of yeasts and algea that is processed into nutrient rich foodstuffs for the local residents. There is still much in the way of imported supplies, however, as variety is important, and not everyone enjoyes eating pure protein all of the time.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government History Spoilers Status: \ncategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: The Tyconderoga\npermalink: /The_Tyconderoga/ "

At any given time there may be as many as fifty million additional people in the city on business, or simply visiting.\nThe crater walls that make up the outside edge of the city house thousands of air-locks and pressureizable hangars of all sizes in order to accommodate all manner of vessel, although all commercial passenger transports use the massive spaceport in order to get in and out of the city.\nThe weaker gravity field of the moon is amplified through the use of gravity levelers that increase the field strength to 1G (Earth normal) gravity, where most habitable locations are kept in order to keep people able to easily transition from location to location without incurring additional health risks.\nWhile there are some manufacturing and agricultural facilities in Tranquility, the city is mostly residential and administrative in nature.\nFeatures/Places of Note Of note in the city of Tranquility is a public/national park that has never been developed.

Trolls normally have large tufts of hair sticking out all over their bodies in strange directions with no apparent rhyme or reason to their placement. Their facial features are gaunt, angular, and almost all severely pointed. They have large, pointy teeth that are asymmetrically placed in their misshaped jaws and long, pointy ears that stick off the sides of their heads at strange angles.\nAll this having been said, trolls are remarkably intelligent creatures that tend to have a very good understanding of the world and most things in it. While extremely strong physically (approaching the strength of ogres), most trolls choose to live solitary, secluded lives, staying out of the affairs of other mortal creatures. A troll\u0026rsquo;s inherent understanding of the world and how it works tends to make them unpopular in most social gatherings as most sentient beings tend to shy away from people that can offer real, valuable solutions to their issues, preferring instead to blunder about their lives looking at things through their own shaded glasses.\nAverage Life Span: 500 to 1200 years.\nAverage Height: 7 to 9 feet.\nAverage Weight: 300 to 500 pounds.\nEyes: Black, yellow, or red.\nHair: Silver or white and very sparse.\n"

However even this pass is fraught with danger as it is infested with gargoyles almost from end to end.\nIt is rumored in some circles that somewhere on the southern tip of the Uraval Mountains, at the peak of the range, beneath the massive, areal city of Avian, is a deep, wide valley. The valley, if it exists, is rumored to be populated by giants that are none too excited about any form of visitors.\nIt is also said that somewhere in the Uraval mountains is the hidden, stronghold city of the enigmatic Obscuri, called Onoba.

Transient Population: Imports: Food, water, labor, machine parts Exports: Heavy metals, minerals, silicates and other raw materials used in the construction of computers, weapons, equipment, and ships.\nDescription Venus is a violent and dangerous place for even the most well-prepared individuals. Its atmosphere is acidic and ranges from hundreds of degrees to thousands of degrees in temperature. Its surface is largely volcanic and is constantly buffeted by hurricane-force winds. All of this does not stop people from living on the planet however, as there are vast stores of heavy metals, minerals, and silicates, all of which are in huge demand throughout the Sol system for the production of ships, weapons, and computer systems.\nThose that choose a life in this harsh environment, usually only do so for a short time, generally for a period of a few months to a couple of years. Anyone choosing to stay longer is often viewed as insane and relegated to the status of ‘hermit.’ There are only a couple larger, permanent cities on Venus and keeping them running is a full-time, and dangerous job that keeps an army of technicians employed. Most other residents spend their days in large, armored vehicles that serve as mobile extraction and processing facilities that roam the surface, looking for useable materials, picking them up, refining them into easily transportable units and then moving on to the next cache. Most individuals who do this for a few months can make enough credits to move themselves into a much higher standard of living for a few years. Working on Venus for a couple of years can set someone up for high living for the rest of their lives! Hermits tend to be people that either desire to be alone, are hiding from ‘the law’ or have just developed a compulsion for ‘the life’. These individuals tend to be eccentric or paranoid in the extreme and are often phenomenally wealthy, although they would never admit to it, nor take time to actually enjoy it, the calling of ‘the life’ is simply too strong for them to ignore! Venus is known throughout the Sol system as having some of the best bars and entertainment in the known universe!\nFeatures/Places of Note Government History Spoilers Status: \ncategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Venus\npermalink: /Venus/ "

Exports: Starships (both sub-luminal and super-luminal).\nDescription While the Earth Ring Station is the largest man-made structure in teh Sol System, The Venus Station is by far the oldest, and densest. What started off as a simple way-station in orbit around Venus has, over the past 5 centuries, transformed into a small, artificial moon! The core of the station is hollow, and attached to a large shaft that connects it to empty space outside. This shaft is home to thousands of landing pads and docking stations for cargo and transport ships of all sizes, while the hollow core serves as a zero-gravity construction yard for ships ranging in size from simple shuttles, to the large capital ships used as military flagships.\nThe shaft and shipyards are kept pressurized, which allows workers to build vessels in zero-G but not have to worry about wearing pressure suits or other zero-atmosphere protective gear. This atmosphere, combined with the minor variations in gravity from place to place along its length, creates eddies, currents, and even dangerous wind storms all along the opening. These winds create navigational hazzards that make traversing the shaft difficult for some pilots who may never fly ships in atmospheres of any kind, let alone in wind storms. The other, and more desireable effect of this, is that all along the shaft there is a continual supply of fresh, cool air.\nThere are hundreds of hotels, bars, and other hospitality facilities all along the shaft, and some of the best shopping deals in teh system can be found here as well, provided shoppers have weeks to peruse the literally thousands of nooks and crannies that shops can be squeeezed into.\nThe interior of the station is composed of layer upon layer of corridors and cavities, some of which contain whole cities filled with actual buildings (with metal ceilings overhead and walls surrounding them). A series of public transportation systems, consisting of monorails, escilators, and elevators allow travel between levels of teh station, but can make navigation extremely difficult, and even hazardous, to those who don\u0026rsquo;t know exactly where they are going. In fact, many people can, and do, go their entire lives without seeing any more of teh station than the small, self-contained city they are born in!\nIn terms of demographics, the closer one gets to teh surface of the station, the wealthier they tend to be, with the one exception of those that live around the very core. Skilled shipwrights make an excellent living, and like to stay close to their projects, so there is a high degree of wealth concentrated in and around the core as well.\nFeatures/Places of Note Government History Spoilers Status: \nCategory:Places_Future\u0026mdash; title: Venus Station\npermalink: /Venus_Station/ "

	"content": " title: Weapon Classifications desc:\ndate: 2019/01/25 version: 1.0.0 template:\nnav: Weapon_Classifications percent: 100 authors:\nWeapons are broken down into classes based upon several factors. Range, Ammunition type (where applicable), damage potential versus organic materials (people), Damage potential versus inorganic materials (structures and vehicles), Weight, and Legality.\nClass A Class A weapons are weapons with limited or no range, blunt or sharp edges designed to cause damage through various forms of bashing, smashing, slicing, chopping, piercing, etc. Examples of Class A weapons would include Swords, Staves, Axes, Knives, Maces, Clubs, Cudgels, Spears, Pole-arms and so on. Also included in this class of weapons are various high tech versions of all of the above, including monowire weapons, high-frequency blades, concussive impact maces and staves and energy blades, which are rare, extremely destructive, and astronomically expensive to own and operate.\nClass B Class B weapons are weapons that fire solid projectiles via expanding gas/chemical propellants such as gun powder and shaped explosive charges. Class B weapons are generally small, light weight, compact weapons that do moderate damage to organic targets and little to no damage to structures and vehicles. Examples of Class B weapons include semi and fully automatic pistols that fire bullets, light sub-machine guns, hunting rifles, bows, cross-bows, arbalests, shot guns, and other such ballistic weapons. Class B weapons are legally available to any civilian with no criminal record on file, or to anyone with enough money and the means to acquire them.\nClass C Class C weapons are weapons that would typically be found only in law enforcement or military operations. They typically are high caliber ballistic weapons, weapons that fire extremely dense solid projectiles through means other than chemical propulsion, and some light energy weapons. Class C weapons are typically extremely effective against organic targets (almost always resulting in death unless wounds are treated immediately), and reasonably effective against lightly armored structures and vehicles. Examples of Class C weapons include medium and heavy assault rifles, sniper rifles, heavy machine guns, gatling cannons, rail cannons (electro-magnetic mass accelerators), ion, and plasma pistols and rifles. This Class of weapons also includes such light explosives as grenades, C4, primer cord, dynamite and a wide array of anti-personnel and anti-vehicle devices. Class C weapons are restricted to government special operations personnel, law enforcement, military, and a few super-powerful corporations, and their use is strictly policed.\nClass D Class D weapons are weapons that are only used by the military and a very select few mega-corporations. These weapons are capable of obscene amounts of destruction. Organic materials are all but instantly and totally destroyed by them and lightly armored vehicles and structures stand little chance of surviving attacks from these weapons. Medium armored vehicles (such as main battle tanks) are likely to be disabled by Class D weapons fire, but usually survive a few hits, and heavily armored structures and vehicles (such as battle ship hulls and bomb shelters) will suffer moderate damage but can withstand several attacks without being disabled or destroyed. Examples of Class D weapons include, stinger and LAW rocket launchers, particle beam cannons, heavy rail cannons, mortars, and such explosive devices as limpet mines and demolition packs. Class D weapons are available ONLY to the military, with only one or two exceptions, and their use by anyone outside of those parameters is highly illegal.\nClass E Class E weapons are included here for completeness’ sake, despite the fact that they are not ‘man portable’ (able to be carried and used by a single person). These weapons are unlikely to hit organic targets directly as they are usually ponderously slow to aim and adjust, but the likelihood of someone dieing from damage inflicted by one of these weapons is almost total. Light and medium vehicles and structures stand no chance what-so-ever, and heavy vehicles and structures will crumble quickly under their assault. These weapons are typically large, turret based, and crew served weapons and more often than not are attached to or built into vehicles and ships such as tanks, battle ships, and so forth. The use of Class E weapons by anyone not in the military is strictly forbidden and punishable by death without trial.\nClass F Class F weapons are classified as weapons of pinpoint accuracy but incredible damage potential. This class of weapons includes laser guided, computer guided, and other ‘intelligent’ weaponry capable of destroying or causing severe damage to the most hardened of structures. These weapons are always launched from air craft/space craft, or other such large platforms (mobile gantries, battle ships, etc.). These weapons will obliterate any organic target that is in their direct blast radius and cause high amounts of ancillary damage through debris and collapsing structures. These weapons are highly illegal in the hands of anyone but the military and their possession/use outside of that arena is punishable by death.\nClass G Class G weapons are classified as weapons of mass destruction. These are nuclear fission and fusion weapons, biological weapons, high energy mass drivers and high yield energy weapons capable of destroying large, city sized areas. These weapons do extreme amounts of damage to all matter, organic or inorganic, and are outlawed summarily.\nCategory:Weapons_Future\u0026mdash; title: Weapon Classifications\npermalink: /Weapon_Classifications/ "

	"content": " title: Weapon Technology desc:\ndate: 2019/01/25 version: 1.0.0 template:\nnav: Weapon_Technology percent: 100 authors:\nWith all of the advances in technology that seem to permeate the everyday lives of the citizens of the Sol System it is often asked, why are there not more advanced weapons in use? The answers are myriad and varied depending upon whom you are speaking to, however there are a few that are commonly cited, and ring true. To begin with, are there more advanced personal weapons available? Absolutely. Examples of which follow this article for those that are curious for more information but include briefly, coherent light energy weapons or lasers, charged particle weapons, or particle beams, ionizing gas discharge or plasma weapons, and many more.\nWhile these sorts of weapons are certainly possible and, today, extremely portable and effective, they do have a few drawbacks, primary of which is obviously cost. These weapons are astronomically expensive to produce and so are available only to the wealthiest of organizations and people. Next on the list of why they are not more common is their potential for damage in the extreme. These weapons are usually so effective that they can not be used within the tight confines of space craft and space stations where the slightest misstep can cause an explosive out-gassing in a habitable area which is, needless to say, a circumstance that most people would want to avoid. Lastly, also because of their destructive potential, most energy weapons have been put on restricted materials lists and are thusly only available to military organizations in the Sol System.\nSo, if all of the energy weapons are too expensive, too dangerous, and too controlled by the government to be used, what then is a person to use to defend themselves with? Fear not, simple ballistics technology has advanced over the years and is still in widespread use in one form or another today. Most of these weapons have evolved, but are still very similar and comparable to those of yester-year. Rather than using crude brass casings that are ejected out the side of the weapon as their propellant is consumed, most weapons now operate on a caseless, shaped charge design where the bullet is impregnated within a shaped explosive charge that is electronically ignited within the breech of the weapon and completely consumed through combustion as the projectile is pushed out the barrel by the process. This allows the weapons to be smaller, lighter, easier to maintain, cheaper to produce and have significantly fewer moving parts (in some cases no moving parts). As a result, projectile weapons have become cheap, easy to use and maintain, and will not kill hundreds (or thousands) of bystanders if discharged inside a vessel, as most bullets are not powerful enough to penetrate starship hull materials.\nPlease bear in mind that some projectile weapons are still controlled items, and thusly only available to the military and similar organizations, but there are a great many that are widely available to the general public with a minimum of hassle.\nNot to be outdone however, technology has also lent itself to the improvement of the age-old classics. Clubs, knives, and swords are still in use today, and in fact they seem to be making a comeback in some circles, particularly pilots and the ultra-wealthy who fancy themselves fencers and swashbucklers like back in the days of yore, around the 23rd century.\nSome modern twists to these old stand-bys include advanced metallurgy that make the blades/surfaces of the weapons extremely light, ultra durable, and able to hold a wicked, surgical edge even through the most rigorous of abuse. Add to this the ability to create high frequency reciprocating blades that will allow any such weapon to slice through the toughest of alloys, and your sword or knife becomes a weapon capable of severing a limb in a flash. Other plays on this old standard include monomolecular blades, a single molecule-wide string suspended within a magnetic field, and the outrageously expensive charged particle or plasma swords where volumes of sun-hot plasma gas are contained within a tightly controlled magnetic field. These ancient weapons with modern twists are not going anywhere soon.\nCategory:Weapons_Future\u0026mdash; title: Weapon Technology\npermalink: /Weapon_Technology/ "

While she knows Riana could very easily replicate most of what she does, she also realizes that her sister has little to no desire to do so, preferring to stay in close combat range, or avoid a fight altogether. As a result, Willhelmina has taken up the mantle of the team sniper and long-range support specialist by the fourth book in the main story arc.\nAt one point, Riana mentions Willhelmina\u0026rsquo;s skills to Vincent and Niko, describing one of her custom made weapons and its ammunition, which is a 25mm hard jacketed, armor piercing round with an electrically fired, oxygen impregnated shaped charge cartridge and a secondary stage \u0026lsquo;ram-jet\u0026rsquo; solid rocket propulsion motor.

The predators have long, whip-like tails that stick straight out behind them like a rudder. Xeracra are solitary hunters that stalk their prey, usually over long distances before pouncing from behind or from the shadows. Their normal tactic is to grip prey with its fore legs and tear it to pieces with its four rear legs to kill it as quickly as possible. Smaller prey is usually caught in its massive jaws and killed by grinding teeth and working it towards its throat.\nAverage Life Span: 50 to 100 years.\nAverage Height: 2 to 3 feet. 8 to 12 feet long.\nAverage Weight: 500 to 900 pounds.\nEyes: Green and black (both)\nHair: Grey with some other colored markings (Usually darker greys and oranges).\n"

The weapon was created with the singular purpose of laying waste to the scourge of dragons that had befallen Kalijor and crushed the will of its people beneath their scaly might. The weapon is imbued with the power to do incredible amounts of damage to beings with draconic blood coursing through their veins but its most devastating power was not even conceived of by the greatest craftsmen and mages on Kalijor until the day it was invoked by its wielder.\nThe greatest Weaponmaster in Kalijor\u0026rsquo;s history was given charge of Zyrik. He was a hulking behemoth of a Minotaur who wielded that massive sword as if it was a simple extension of his arm and at the head of the elven and dwarven armies he cut a swath through the hordes of dragons making the land safe again for the people of Kalijor. But he knew that in order to be truly safe, the land would have to be rid of the dragon king Tellamon. So the nameless Weaponmaster left his armies behind and forged ahead into the blinding snow and driving winds of the Southern wastes where, ant the top of the highest peak in the bleak night he faced Tellamon in single combat for the fate of Kalijor. On through the night they battled and it is said that explosions of magic and flashes of light could be seen as far away as the Burning Expanse and that the thunderous clash of enchanted steel on ancient scale and bone could be felt by the youngest of babes laying silently in their cradles as the world held its breath in anticipation. But it was not to be. Despite the dwarves best efforts, the mighty Zyrik was not powerful enough to smite the great king Tellamon. Until in one final, desperate act of selflessness, the unnamed Weaponmaster offered up his own life, forcing his heart and soul into one final devastating blow. It is said that the light from Zyrik\u0026rsquo;s blade shone like a beacon in the failing night sky and lit up the Gelid mountains like a thousand stars on the clearest night, and the great beast was undone and his grip on Kalijor was loosed forever. Of the unnamed Weaponmaster there was nothing remaining save or the sapphire he wore around his neck. As tribute to his strength and ultimate sacrifice, the sapphire was imbedded within the pommel of the great dragon slayer Zyrik and to this day, any who find themselves in the most desperate of conflicts with the life and freedom of many on the line can call upon the will of the unnamed hero and offer up their own life in exchange for the destruction of one who would threaten Kalijor.\nThis massive sword is nine feet long, gleaming silver, and bears a simple, but elegant handle, hilt, and pommel. Its only distinguishing feature, aside from its exquisite craftsmanship and balance, is the large sapphire mounted in the base of the pommel. There are a series of dwarven runes running down the blade\u0026rsquo;s fuller, however they are so subtle as to be almost unnoticeable except under extremely close scrutiny.\nWhen used against normal foes, the weapon functions as a normal, albeit exceptional, weapon. However when used against any creature with draconic blood in its veins, the claymore will glow brightly whenever it comes into contact with the creature\\\u0026rsquo;s body. The swords is also able to block dragon breath attacks, causing them splay out away from the wielder of the claymore, as if some sort of magical barrier is deflecting it.\nCategory:Weapons_Kalijor\u0026mdash; title: Zyrik\npermalink: /Zyrik/ "

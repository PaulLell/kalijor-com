The following stories take place long before the novels, when Riana and Katrina were naught but younglings growing up in the city of Rathalon.

The following stories are just for fun. They are not Kalijor related but hopefully still entertaining!<br />
<a title="Zyrk" href="https://www.kalijor.com/books/short-stories/zyrk/">Zyrk</a> is a character that I created for a contest on the <a title="Deviant Art" href="http://www.deviantart.com" target="_blank">Deviant Art</a> website. Still no word on how I fared, but I thought I could share it with you anyway. The story starts off with a statistical look at the main character, Zyrk.&nbsp; Then it moves into the actual story. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it! <em>(unedited) Updated 1/31/08</em>

<a title="Trinkets and Trash" href="https://www.kalijor.com/books/short-stories/trinkets-and-trash/" target="_blank">Trinkets and Trash</a> is a story about a private detective that has gone in search of a client's missing possession. He encounters a little resistance along the way. This piece was written just for fun. <em>(unedited) Updated 1/31/08</em>

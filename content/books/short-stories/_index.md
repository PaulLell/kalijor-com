The following stories are just for fun. They are not Kalijor related but hopefully still entertaining!

[Zyrk](./zyrk/) is a character that I created for a contest on the [Deviant Art](http://www.deviantart.com) website. Still no word on how I fared, but I thought I could share it with you anyway. The story starts off with a statistical look at the main character, Zyrk.&nbsp; Then it moves into the actual story. Anyway, I hope you enjoy it! *(unedited) Updated 1/31/08*

[Trinkets and Trash](./trinkets-and-trash) is a story about a private detective that has gone in search of a client's missing possession. He encounters a little resistance along the way. This piece was written just for fun. *(unedited) Updated 1/31/08*

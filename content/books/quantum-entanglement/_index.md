<h3>Product Description</h3>
<div>
A great American author once wrote: Any sufficiently analyzed magic is indistinguishable from technology.

Or something like that.

In the late 90's, scientists at the Superconducting Super Collider in Texas discovered a link to the quantum world that allowed people to manipulate the energy of the universe with thought alone. Now, magic is everywhere and almost anyone is able to use it, with the proper license. It has elevated medicine, science, and culture to stratospheric heights and changed the face of our world. But magic isn't as new as people think. It's been with us for quite some time. And as the saying goes, with great power&hellip;

Ocelot is a world class assassin with a style all her own. She avoids connections, dislikes obligations, and would sell her own sister to the mob (but just that once) to avoid being drawn into someone else's drama. So, naturally, she is drawn in, and finds herself working with a mage to prevent a major corporation from throwing the delicate balance of science, magic, and the law out the window. Even though there is nothing she would rather do less, but a promise is a promise. And a promise to a dragon is... well, still a promise.

But it's also a promise... TO A DRAGON!

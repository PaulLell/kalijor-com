![Riana](images/Riana-2key-187x300.jpg) Home to some of the most amazing science fiction and fantasy novels available in any format.

Kalijor is a virtual fantasy setting within a corporate-run future where the earth is a barren, nuclear wasteland and humanity now lives spread out amongst the planets, and even a few neighboring stars.

The characters in the Kalijor novels are denizens of a world in which CEO's determine the course of people's lives and corporate espionage is akin to an armed border incursion.

This is a world of cybernetics, psionics, genetic engineering, and super science, but that's not all.

Within the virtual reality world of Kalijor, people can interact with one another in real-time even over vast, interstellar distances. Kalijor is a world of high fantasy where people's avatars can choose to take on epic quests, craft invaluable relics, or just hang out at the local tavern with their friend from across the solar system.

In a digital world where electrons are king, information and currency exchanged in Kalijor actually moves from person to person in the real world. Kalijor is used as a place for business meetings, clandestine deals, and corporate subterfuge. But is there more to the world of Kalijor than meets the eye? Is the line between there and the real world as impenetrable as corporate leadership would have their citizens believe?

On this site you will find news and information about the world of Kalijor, and the books in which you can read about all of the people in it. So have a look around, see what you think. Read some sample chapters and check out the wiki where the author keeps track of all the characters, ships, places, equipment, and more. And if you feel so inclined, drop by the forums and say hello!

## Vital Statistics

**Full Name:** Katrina Annwyn Thorindal
![Katrina_Solo.png](/images/Katrina_Solo.png "Katrina_Solo.png") **Aliases:**
**Avatar/Player:** [Willhelmina Orlova](Willhelmina_Orlova "wikilink")
**Occupation:** Mage
**Date of Birth:** 38 years old
**Height:** 6'1"
**Weight:** 125lbs
**Hair Color:** Metallic Platinum
**Eye Color:** Golden Yellow
**Physical Description:** Physically, Katrina stands just shy of six
feet tall and weighs in around one-hundred-ten pounds. She is fit, but
spends the majority of her free time with her nose in a book. She has a
thin frame and is not weak, but obviously spends very little time
exercising. Her skin is the light color of an elf that spends most of
her time indoors and under cover since the majority of their adventures
have taken place within the city walls. She has long, metallic platinum
hair that, when loose, hangs down to the middle of her back. She has
bright, gold eyes and long tapered ears that are extremely expressive of
her emotions. Her facial features are delicate, with high cheek bones
and thin eyebrows. She is beautiful by most standards and spends some
time trying to keep herself presentable, although the effort is really
not that great, more of a passing concern that is quickly overridden by
her studies.

## General Description

Katrina is the twin sister of [Riana
Thorindal](Riana_Shandra_Thorindal "wikilink"). They grew up together in
[Rathalon](Rathalon "wikilink"), getting into trouble and generally
being kids. They studied together at the [Magic
Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink") where Katrina chose to become a pure
Mage, with a focus on spells of destruction and holding.

Katrina is friendly when approached, but normally looks as though she
doesn't want to interact with people because her head is almost always
stuck in a book of some kind. She loves to sit in a tavern with her
sister while she munches on light snacks and listens to adventurers
wander in and out, telling their stories. She tends to be reserved
around new people but always gives them the benefit of the doubt. Once
someone has proven to her that they are not trustworthy, she will never
be inclined to trust them again, but those she calls friend, and those
in need will always take precedence in her life.

## History

Katrina was born in the trade city of [Rathalon](Rathalon "wikilink") to
[Ezrina Thorindal](Ezrina_Reyals-Thorindal "wikilink"). Together with
her twin sister, Riana, they grew up learning the ins and outs of the
city and its surrounding areas. At the age of ten, their mother enrolled
the twins in the [Magic Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink") where Katrina
quickly found a love for the arcane arts.

While her sister was busy skipping classes to sneak out and learn to use
a sword, Katrina threw herself into her studies. She quickly established
herself as a star pupil and was moved into advanced classes. Over the
years of her tenure at the academy she was given special access to some
of the higher levels of the Great Library and allowed to assist in
research of new and more powerful spells. She received high marks in
alchemy and elementalism but decimated the curve in her incantations
classes, consistently demonstrating that there was no spell beyond her
abilities.

Her spell book quickly grew in size as she became more and more adept
and was eventually invited to assist in the teaching of classes in
preparation for becoming a full teacher at the academy when she
graduated. However, she surprised the institution when she refused the
position and instead, left the academy to travel with her sister in
exploring [Kalijor](Kalijor "wikilink").

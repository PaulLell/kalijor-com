# General Description

Calm, cool and collected. Vargrus was the pillar that held up the group when all
else was falling down around them. Likewise he was also the infuriatingly calm
and imperturbable one of the group. He was a fiercely loyal man who always held
to his convictions no matter the pressures around him.

Valkyrie](../ambrai_valkyrie). Together they bore several children and

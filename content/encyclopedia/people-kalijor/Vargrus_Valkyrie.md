## General Description

Calm, cool and collected. Vargrus was the pillar that held up the group
when all else was falling down around them. Likewise he was also the
infuriatingly calm and imperturbable one of the group. He was a fiercely
loyal man who always held to his convictions no matter the pressures
around him.

Vargrus was a human warrior who became the husband of [Ambrai
Valkyrie](Ambrai_Valkyrie "wikilink"). Together they bore several
children and eventually Vargrus died of natural causes.

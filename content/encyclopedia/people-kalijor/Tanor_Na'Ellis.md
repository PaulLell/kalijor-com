## Vital Statistics

**Full Name:** Tanor Na'Ellis
**Aliases:**
**Avatar/Player:**
**Occupation:** Druid
**Date of Birth:** 250 years old
**Height:** 6'3"
**Weight:** 185lbs
**Hair Color:** Black
**Eye Color:** Green
**Physical Description:** Tanor is a tall, slightly overweight (for an
Elf) Druid that makes his home in [Pandoria](Pandoria "wikilink").

## General Description

He seems to have high political goals and is of an undetermined level of
power as a magic user as no one can seem to remember a time when they
have seen him use his abilities. He has money, and power, and seems to
want more of both, although he understands that he must expend some of
his resources in order to acquire more.

Tanor is something of an enigma. No one seems to know whether he is an
NPC or a avatar. He works with the Druid council but also against them
at times when he needs something they are unlikely to give him.

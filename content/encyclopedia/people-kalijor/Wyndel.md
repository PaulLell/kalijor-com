# General Description

Aloof and contemplative, Wyndel seemed a great and powerful elf until his evil
streak revealed itself when his wife [Annwyn](../annwyn_thorindal) was
revealed to be pregnant.  Wyndel turned out to be evil to the core. He was cold,
calculating, and methodical in his planning and execution. Once he set his sight
on a goal he would do nearly anything to reach it, except play by the rules.

Elven father of [Kilishandra Thorindal](../kilishandra_thorindal). Wyndel was
mad with the acquisition of power and went so far as to try and seduce his
daughter to the side of evil before she finally destroyed him in a battle that
cost her own life. Wyndel was a masterful mage, specializing in the arts of
necromancy and manipulation.

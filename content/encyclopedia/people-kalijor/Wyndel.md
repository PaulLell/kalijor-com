## General Description

Aloof and contemplative, Wyndel seemed a great and powerful elf until
his evil streak revealed itself when his wife
[Annwyn](Annwyn_Thorindal "wikilink") was revealed to be pregnant.
Wyndel turned out to be evil to the core. He was cold, calculating, and
methodical in his planning and execution. Once he set his sight on a
goal he would do nearly anything to reach it, except play by the rules.

Elven father of [Kilishandra
Thorindal](Kilishandra_Thorindal "wikilink"). Wyndel was mad with the
acquisition of power and went so far as to try and seduce his daughter
to the side of evil before she finally destroyed him in a battle that
cost her own life. Wyndel was a masterful mage, specializing in the arts
of necromancy and manipulation.

## History

Rhaeton was a half-elf orphan living in [Pandoria](Pandoria "wikilink")
when [Kilishandra](Kilishandra_Thorindal "wikilink") was young, just out
of the [Magic Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink"). Kilishandra caught
Rhaeton trying to flee an angry cook after she had stolen a loaf of
bread from his kitchen. Rhaeton was amazed when Kilishandra paid for the
bread and sent the cook on his way, and then invited Rhaeton to stay
with her until she could start earning some money and get a place of her
own.

Rhaeton did eventually start making some money, using her skills as a
rogue to help the defenders in [Pandoria](Pandoria "wikilink") track
down criminals and running scouting missions for them, but the two never
parted ways. Rhaeton and Kilishandra had developed strong feelings for
one another over the years and eventually consummated their relationship
and agreed to live together forever. But it was not meant to be.

One day the two were confronted by an enraged mage who had somehow found
his stolen spell book in Rhaeton’s belongings. During the confrontation
that followed Rhaeton ended up stepping in front of a fireball meant for
Kilishandra, who had entered the fray in defense of her lover, and died
on the spot.

Decades later, she was reincarnated by a powerful mage named
[Wyndel](Wyndel "wikilink"), into a male [Obscuri](Obscuri "wikilink")
body. Wyndel filled Rhaeton’s head with images of Kilishandra and
[Ezrina](Ezrina_Reyals-Thorindal "wikilink") and told him/her that
he/she could have Kilishandra back if he/she was to kill her with a
magical dagger, freeing her spirit so that the two could mingle forever
in the afterlife. Twisted by his/her time in the spirit world, and the
lies constantly spoken by Wyndel, Rhaeton took up the dagger and tracked
down his/her former lover.

After he/she stabbed Kilishandra with the dagger, Rhaeton surrendered
him/herself over to Kilishandra’s friends and told them the story of how
he/she came to be there, and of Wyndel and his plans. They kept him/her
locked up until Kilishandra and Wyndel destroyed one another, at which
point Wyndel’s spell ended and Rhaeton returned to oblivion, his/her new
body crumbling to dust.

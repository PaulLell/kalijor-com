## Vital Statistics

**Full Name:** Riana Shandra Thorindal ![Riana_Solo.png](Riana_Solo.png
"Riana_Solo.png") ![RianaSolo.png](/images/RianaSolo.png "RianaSolo.png")
**Aliases:**
**Avatar/Player:**
**Occupation:** Spell-Sword in Kalijor, Corporate Courier in the real
world
**Date of Birth:** July 14, 3039 in the real world
**Height:** 6'1" in both Kalijor and the real world
**Weight:** 135lbs in Kalijor, 350 lbs in the real world (but looks 135
lbs)
**Hair Color:** Royal Purple
**Eye Color:** Violet
**Physical Description:** Physically, Riana stands around six feet tall
and weighs in around one-hundred-thirty pounds. She is extremely fit,
spending a great deal of time in physical training/conditioning. She is
deceptively strong for her size, with a svelte frame and great muscle
tone. Her skin is the light color of an elf that spends most of her time
indoors and under cover since the majority of their adventures have
taken place within the city walls. She has long, dark purple hair that,
when loose, hangs down to the middle of her back, although she usually
keeps it up in a ponytail. She has deep violet eyes and long tapered
ears that are extremely expressive of her emotions. Her facial features
are delicate, with high cheek bones and thin eyebrows (also dark purple
in color). She is beautiful by most standards although she would never
admit it, or even think about it, and spends almost no time trying to
enhance her looks in any way.

In Kalijor, Riana is of average height for an elf of royal blood
(although she had no idea until she and Katrina were out adventuring
that they were of royal descent).

In the real world Riana looks to have an athletic build, despite her
weight which is caused by her unique body. Save for the absence of her
mystical tattoos, Riana looks identical in Kalijor to the way she
appears in the real world.

## General Description

She does her best to live a normal life but keeps finding herself in
strange situations. She is an accomplished martial artist, studying
under [Master Jonin](Jonin_Himabari "wikilink"), loves to fly [The
Kestrel](The_Kestrel "wikilink") whenever she can and has a crush on one
[Vincent Torres](Vincent_Torres "wikilink").

Information: Riana is the twin sister of [Katrina
Thorindal](Katrina_Annwyn_Thorindal "wikilink"). They grew up together
in [Rathalon](Rathalon "wikilink"), getting into trouble and generally
being kids. They studied together at the [Magic
Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink") where Riana chose to become a
Spell-Sword, with a focus on spells of destruction and holding.

In the real world, Riana is a cyborg of extremely advanced design (she
could be called an android except that she as many organic parts). Her
bones are a composite of a titanium-like alloy wrapped around a
honeycomb of high strength carbon-carbon. Her muscle tissue is an
advanced Kevlar-like material with a massively stronger tensile strength
than any human tissue, genetically augmented or otherwise and her skin
is grown around interwoven layers of reactive fibrous armor. Her senses,
muscles, and reflexes have all been tuned to their utmost capabilities,
well beyond human potential and that of most cybernetic technology of
the day. Her mind is interfaced directly with an advanced computer
system that increases her comprehension, retention, and recall
capabilities as well. In point of fact, she has so few organic systems
that she is more android than cyborg, although her brain, spinal column
and, in fact, her entire nervous systems are all organic. Her nervous
system is a cloned copy of [Willhelmina
Orlova's](Willhelmina_Orlova "wikilink"), with some minor tweaks to
accommodate both Riana's unique consciousness and the organic/machine
interface.

Riana is friendly and outgoing, eager to meet new people and hear their
tales of adventure. She loves to sit in a tavern and munch on light
snacks while watching adventurers wander in and out, telling their
stories. She assumes the best about people until they prove to be
unworthy of her trust and will go to great lengths for a friend or
anyone in need of help.

## History

Riana Thorindal was born to [Ezrina
Thorindal](Ezrina_Reyals-Thorindal "wikilink") in the trade city of
Rathalon. As a young elf, she and her twin sister
[Katrina](Katrina_Annwyn_Thorindal "wikilink") spent most of their time
exploring the city and getting into whatever trouble they could scrounge
up. They learned the ins and outs of the city and all of its secret
highways and byways until they were ten, at which point they were
enrolled at the [Magic Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink") to begin
practicing the mage arts.

Partway through her second year at the [Magic
Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink"), Riana began skipping some of her
classes in order to sneak out to a local fishing village where an old
adventurer was teaching her the art of the sword. For several years she
kept her sword practice a secret from her mother, but she knew she could
not keep up the lies for long.

In her fifth year at the academy, she was playing with some enchantments
in one of the academy alchemy labs when the compound she was working on
exploded in her face (due to the fact that she did not remember the
appropriate protection spell to keep her volatile compound in check).
The result of the explosion, she was officially suspended from the
academy labs and all of her hair began to grow out in a thick, dark,
purple color from that day forward.

For a few months she tried dying her hair so as to hide the new color
from her mother but eventually she gave up trying to keep her secret.
She told her mother that she had been skipping classes in order to study
sword play and stopped dying her hair. Her mother surprised her by
saying she knew about the classes and further, by giving her a new,
dwarven short sword that she had commissioned specifically for Riana.

After that day, Riana spent half her day at the academy in her
incantation classes (both offensive and defensive), and the other half
in the fishing village with the weapon-master, learning the art of the
sword. Over time she began to integrate her skills and became a true
spell-sword.

The twin's adventures led them all over the northern-half of the [Plain
of Serenity](Plain_of_Serenity "wikilink") and into the [Southern
Wastes](Southern_Wastes "wikilink"). They got into a lot of trouble, but
also managed to accumulate some acclaim through their adventures. During
her final term at the [Magic Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink"), Riana
spent a great deal of time and energy researching ancient languages and
symbolism, even going so far as to sneak into the restricted levels of
the Great Library in order to formulate a series of special inks,
incantations, and markings that allowed the dwarven artisan,
[Dinendal](Dinendal "wikilink"), to apply her magical tattoos. The
markings cover the majority of her body below her neck and all appear as
a series of black, interlocking, almost tribal tattoos. However when she
concentrates on casting a particular spell, the tattoo that represents
that spell will glow into bright, vivid color (as do her eyes) as the
effect of the spell is produced. Invoking the power associated with the
magical tattoos causes her to experience symptoms of physical
exhaustion, increasing in severity as the power of the spell increases.
The exhaustion is not so bad that it knocks her out immediately, more
like each spell having the same effect of having jogged around the base
of a tree for a few minutes. The trick is that the effects are
cumulative and she can wear herself out quickly if she is in physical
combat and using her magic as well.

A side effect of her tattoos is that she is no longer able to cast
spells through the normal means of memorizing the incantations and
reciting them. Instead, she must research the spell's effects, find an
appropriate marking and formulate a compatible, enchanted ink. Then she
must have the mark permanently applied to her body in order to invoke
the spell. When she first had the tattoos applied, she included a great
many spells that she did not yet know how to control, and as a result
she still has a lot of research to do in order to increase her
understanding of the spells enough to actually invoke them.

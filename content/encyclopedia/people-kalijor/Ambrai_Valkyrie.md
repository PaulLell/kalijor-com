## History

Ambrai Valkyrie was an elf that grew up in Pandoria and the [Forest of
Brume](Forest_of_Brume "wikilink"). She took readily to the arts of the
Ranger, against her parent’s wishes for her to follow the family path of
the Druid. In order to be less in their view, she took to adventuring at
a young age and learned most of her skills in the world at large, from
anyone who would teach her.

Eventually she fell into the company of [Ezrina
Reyals](Ezrina_Reyals-Thorindal "wikilink"), and [Kilishandra
Thorindal](Kilishandra_Thorindal "wikilink") and their friends.
Eventually, Ambrai developed feelings for a human martial artist that
traveled with them regularly and was in the middle of professing her
feelings for him in an inn room in [Rathalon](Rathalon "wikilink") when
Kilishandra broke down the door and confessed her own love for Ambrai.
In the confusion that followed this event, Kilishandra started spending
more time away from the group and Ambrai pursued her love of the
warrior, [Vargrus](Vargrus_Valkyrie "wikilink").

Shortly thereafter, Kilishandra was stabbed with a cursed dagger by her
reincarnated first lover, [Rhaeton](Rhaeton "wikilink"), and started
sliding down the path to her eventual death. When Ezrina also fell under
the dagger and a solution was proposed requiring another, uncursed
individual, Ambrai quickly volunteered to assist. During the ritual she
was exposed to Kilishandra’s true, raw emotions, and understood how much
she really did lover her. But she touched on something else in
Kilishandra’s mind, and realizing that it was the seed of the curse,
quickly absorbed it into her own mind and hid it away.

After the ritual concluded and was declared a success, Ambrai went back
to her life with Vargrus, harboring the secret of what she had done to
save her friends. Over time, she and Vargrus bore children and as he
grew old Ambrai realized that she would eventually be alone. She had
second thoughts about her decision to refuse Kilishandra’s love, a love
that would last for centuries or more, as they were both elf kind.

After Vargrus died of old age, the seed of evil long locked away in her
mind cracked open and began to grow, fed by Ambrai’s feelings of doubt
and loneliness. Eventually the darkness inside her took hold of her mind
and she turned down the path of darkness. She exhumed the body of
Kilishandra and reanimated it using magic she had stolen from a lich she
had slain.

Divining the source of Ezrina’s ability to bear children and finding the
amulet buried with Kilishandra’s body, Ambrai developed a plan to
rekindle the love she felt she had denied herself all those years ago.
She began slaying adventurers in order to recharge the amulet so that
she might also bear a child of Kilishandra’s blood.

## General Description

On the short side for a royal elf, Ezrina is an extremely adept mage
with power enough that some think she has drawn the attention of the
[Obscuri](Obscuri "wikilink"). She is quiet and thoughtful most of the
time but can be a bit bi-polar. She is normally very receptive to others
and enjoys good company but sometimes she will suddenly dismiss herself
and disappear for weeks on end, it is during these times that she cries
he heart out for her lost love.

## History

Ezrina is the mother of [Riana](Riana_Shandra_Thorindal "wikilink") and
[Katrina](Katrina_Annwyn_Thorindal "wikilink") Thorindal. Ezrina was a
member of the royal house of [Pandoria](Pandoria "wikilink"), next in
line for the throne, until she fell in love with one of her adventuring
companions, [Kilishandra Thorindal](Kilishandra_Thorindal "wikilink").
During their adventures, Ezrina and Kilishandra had developed close
ties, although Ezrina had no idea how close they actually were until she
took part in a magic ritual to save the life of both Kilishandra and
herself.

During the ritual their minds were temporarily merged and Ezrina was
exposed for the first time to the breadth of Kilishandra’s feelings for
her. After the ritual they were finally able to profess their love for
one another, and after a few short days, Kilishandra went off to
confront her father and they both ended up killing one another, leaving
Ezrina heartbroken and alone.

In her will, Kilishandra left a magical amulet to Ezrina that was touted
to have the ability to make the first female that donned it conceive a
child born of her and Kilishandra’s blood. After many years of lonely
soul searching, Ezrina decided to put on the amulet, and within a week
she was with child. Knowing her family could never understand, or bear
the public shame of her relationship and the source of her children,
Ezrina denounced her claim to the Reyals name and throne. Moving to
Cohai, she took up Kilishandra’s family name of Thorindal.

The twins were born in the [Cohai
Observatory](Cohai_Observatory "wikilink") not long after, and then the
family moved into an apartment that her family anonymously donated to
her in [Rathalon](Rathalon "wikilink").

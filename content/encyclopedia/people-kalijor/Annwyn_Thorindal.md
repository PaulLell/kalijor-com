## History

After [Kilishandra](Kilishandra_Thorindal "wikilink") was born and
[Wyndel](Wyndel "wikilink") seemed to go mad, Annwyn stole away from him
and raised Kilishandra within the protective walls of
[Cohai](Cohai_Observatory "wikilink") until she was old enough to attend
the [Magic Academy](Magic_Academy "wikilink"). Once Kilishandra was
enrolled and off to school, Annwyn went to challenge Wyndel one last
time and was killed.

# History

After [Kilishandra](../kilishandra_thorindal) was born and [Wyndel](../wyndel)
seemed to go mad, Annwyn stole away from him and raised Kilishandra within the
protective walls of [Cohai](../../places-kalijor/cohai_observatory) until she
was old enough to attend the [Magic
Academy](../../places-kalijor/magic_academy). Once Kilishandra was enrolled and
off to school, Annwyn went to challenge Wyndel one last time and was killed.

## General Description

Exodus is a human mage who is an understudy of [Master
Gornin](Gornin "wikilink") at the [Cohai
Observatory](Cohai_Observatory "wikilink"). He is an extremely
accomplished wielder of the arcane arts, specializing in spells of
teleportation and transportation.

He typically examines any given situation from all possible angles
before taking action, but seems to understand that sometimes direct
action is required quickly and is capable of acting under pressure
fairly well. While seemingly very quiet and reserved, he is an extremely
passionate individual who will go to great lengths for anyone he sees as
a friend.

## Spoilers

<spoiler text="Status">Exodus is killed by Malice at the end of the
Third Key of Kalijor (a murder that also kills Jax, his player in the
real world), but managed to live on through a copy of his mind that Jax
had made prior to his murder. He persists through the fourth and most of
the fifth books, taking the form of an animated, floating book in
Kalijor, and a disembodied mind living in computers and on the net in
the real world. However, by the end of the Fifth Key of Kalijor, he is
alive and well, living in Kalijor with Katrina in Pandoria.</spoiler>

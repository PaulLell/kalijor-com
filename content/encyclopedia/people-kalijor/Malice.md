suffering in others and seems to derive no greater satisfaction than
causing someone to break down. He is a consummate strategist. Always
thinking two or three moves ahead of his opponents in combat and out. It
is unknown at this time who plays Malice, but it is known that he is an
avatar and not an NPC.

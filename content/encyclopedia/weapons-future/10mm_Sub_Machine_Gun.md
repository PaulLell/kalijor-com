The 10mm caseless round is the standard amunition for most weapons in
the Sol system including law enforcement and military weapons. Most
sub-machine guns used by spec-ops personnel have a standard 30 round
magazine and selective firing modes of safe, semi-automatic (one round
per trigger pull), burst (three rounds per trigger pull), and full
automatic (fires for as long as the trigger is held down). These weapons
are extremely reliable, easy to clean and fire in all environments and
conditions including the vacuum of space (The shaped charge propellant
is oxygen impregnated so that it has everything needed to fire in any
environment).

Effective Range: 2,500 feet

Maximum Range: 4,000 feet

Magazine Capacity: 30 rounds normally, 50 rounds for top loaded
'bull-pup' designs.

Weapon Class: B

The standard configuration for these sub-machine guns is the regular
short barrel and short stock with the magazine located in the bottom
center of the weapon just in front of the hand grip and trigger
assembly. This represents the least expensive and most widely available
design for this type of weapon.

A variation of this type of weapons is known as the 'bull-pup' where the
magazine is located either on top of the weapon, seated in parallel with
the barrel, or under the weapon at the back, feeding up through the
stock. The hand grip and trigger assembly remains either in the center
of the weapon or more toward the front. This arrangement allows the
weapon to have a longer barrel which increases accuracy while at the
same time keeping the overall length of the weapon the same, or in some
cases even shorter than the standard design. In the case of a
top-mounted magazine this design also allows for a greatly increased
ammunition capacity and better overall weapon balance and firing
characteristics.

These weapons can be outfitted with a number of accessories and
attachments including silencers/suppressors, laser sights, balancers,
advanced sights, custom hand grips and grip frames, longer barrels for
increased accuracy, modified hammer and sear assemblies that adjust
trigger sensitivity and refire rate, and much more. The weapons are
relatively easy to conceal, well balanced, and widely available.

title: Flash Bang
---

Flash-bangs are a particular type of grenade that are used by law enforcement
for the specific purpose of crowd control in enclosed areas.  A flash-bang, when
triggered, will release an extremely loud, deafening noise, along with a
blinding pulse of light. Together these two effects will stun and disorient the
people near the point of the detonation.

Range: About 40 to 100 feet when thrown by an average person. Can be upwards of
250 feet when thrown by someone with cybernetic/genetic augmentation.

Weapon Class: A

Small flash-bangs are readily available at most specialty and weapon shops and
the larger versions suitable for riot control are available at surplus and law
enforcement supply shops. Either way they are fairly easy to obtain for the
general public and relatively cheap.

Class 1 These individuals are the top echelon of martial arts experts.
They have dedicated their entire lives to the study of the martial arts
and associated philosophies. Class 1 combatants are typically fifth
degree or higher black belts in two or more styles and have studied
extensively in multiple additional forms of martial arts. Through
decades of devotion and constant practice they have become masters of
their art, although they still constantly seek to hone their skills and
develop new techniques. Class 1 combatants are typically able to defeat
any other classification of combatant with relative ease, but they will
almost always go to extensive lengths to avoid any such confrontations.
They only use their skills if there is absolutely no other way around
it. However, when they do unleash their power, it is a sight to behold.

Class 2 Combatants are individuals who have dedicated themselves to the
study and mastery of themselves and the martial arts. These individuals
tend to be more spiritual and in tune with themselves and their
surroundings and through (usually) years of constant practice and self
improvement they have achieved a second, third, or fourth degree black
belt in a formal martial arts training program. Some street fighters can
achieve this classification although it is rare to see. Class 2
combatants are generally able to defeat anyone of class 3 or higher
rankings with little effort, although some particularly gifted Class 3
opponents may provide more of a challenge.

Class 3 Hand to Hand combatants are people that have achieved a black
belt or above in a structured formal, or intense street training
program. These individuals have chosen to fully integrate the martial
arts into their daily lives on all levels and are extremely adept in
combat. Class 3 combatants are able to defend reasonably well against
class 2 combatants although they will have trouble pressing the attack
against them. Class 4 and lower combatants are generally not a challenge
against a Class 3 individual unless they are particularly adept at their
craft and on the rise.

Class 4 These individuals are people with some form of structured or
street-learned combat education. This would include municipal self
defense programs, collage classes, or private lessons up to a blue belt
in most formal training programs. These individuals are able to make a
good showing of themselves in most situations against some Class 3 rated
combatants, will be on generally even terms with other Class 4â€™s and
will usually win hands down against any Class 5 combatants.

Class 5 People with minimal or no combat training at all. These people
are barely able to defend themselves at the best of times.

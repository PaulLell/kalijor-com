The 10mm caseless round is the standard amunition for most weapons in
the Sol system, including law enforcement and military personnel. The
auto-pistol favored by most spec-ops personnel has a standard 15 round
magazine and selective firing modes of safe, semi-automatic (one round
per trigger pull), burst (three rounds per trigger pull), and full
automatic (fires for as long as the trigger is held down). There is also
a 30 round extended magazine for the weapon that will extend full-auto
firing time but unbalances the weapon slightly and makes it more
difficult to conceal. These weapons are extremely reliable, easy to
clean, and fire in all environments and conditions including the vacuum
of space (The shaped charge propellant is oxygen impregnated so that it
has everything needed to fire in any environment).

Effective Range: 1,000 feet

Maximum Range: 2,100 feet

Magazine Capacity: 15 rounds normal, 30 rounds long

Weapon Class: B

These weapons can be outfitted with a number of accessories and
attachments including silencers/suppressors, laser sights, balancers,
advanced sights, custom hand grips and grip frames, longer barrels for
increased accuracy, modified hammer and sear assemblies that adjust
trigger sensitivity and refire rate, and more. The weapons are easily
concealable, well balanced, and widely available.

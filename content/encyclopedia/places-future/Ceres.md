**Permanent Population:** Fifty million
**Transient Population:** 500,000 to one million

## Description

The largest of the planetoids in the [Asteroid
Belt](Asteroid_Belt "wikilink") and home to more than fifty million
people and families who choose to live 'off the grid' as disidents.
Ceres is the heart of the [Dregs](Dregs "wikilink"), if there were such
a place, and is where most business is conducted in the asteroid belt.

Ceres is also home to several large manufacturing outfits that are
responsible for the majority of the goods and materials that are
unofficially exported back to
[Conglomerate](The_Conglomerate "wikilink") facilities. There are even
several small ship yards in Ceres local space, making ships that are
essentially illegal, unable to land in or operate around any
Conglomerate facilities without first going through a tremendous number
of hoops to be registered.

## Features/Places of Note

## Government

Ceres is a member of the larger group known publicly as 'The Dregs'. As
a member of this community, it is subject to the same charter of
operations as the rest of the community. Legislative/operational policy
is decided by public assembly and debate that is presided over by a
minimum of 99 heads of family.

Most policy is debated and decided upon by the council of family heads
and once a decision is made and agreed upon, it is posted publically and
can be stopped before it is officially inacted if 50%+1 of registered
voters disagree with the resolution.

Similarly, any registered voter may bring a resolution before the
assembly, make a case for it in teh public forum/debate, and have it
posted as a proposed policy, at which point it is voted upon by all
registered voters, including the heads of household that make up the
current counsil of family heads. If such a resolution should receive
50%+1 positive votes from the registered voter base, then it is ratified
into action.

Any resolutions can be repealed/removed from operation by similar means.
Someone must publicly speak out at the forum to ask for its removal, at
which point it is voted upon just like any act that is working to be
made official.

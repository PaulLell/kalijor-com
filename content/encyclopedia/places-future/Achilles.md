## Description

One of the major Martian cities, Achilles is located near the western
edge of the Valles Marineris, a three-thousand mile long, mile deep
trench that hugs the planet’s equator. Near the eastern edge of the same
fissure lies the sister city of Hector . The two cities are now in the
process of enclosing the vast expanse of trench between them, nearly
eighteen hundred miles, and terra-forming the floor of the trench into a
rain forest. Achilles is the manufacturing capitol of Mars. Most of the
planet’s research and development happens here, funded by the solar
system’s major corporations. The city is designed around a central shaft
that sinks eight thousand feet into the Martian bedrock with residential
and commercial facilities at the top of the shaft, closer to the dome
that covers the shaft and permits sunlight to enter. The bottom half of
the shaft is all manufacturing facilities, factories, and laboratories.

Achilles is the primary manufacturing city on Mars. It is one of the
great wonders of human engineering in the Sol system. The entire city is
built around a single central shaft that is dug down more than
eight-thousand feet into the surface of the planet. This shaft is capped
off with a large dome to allow as much sunlight as possible into the
city, but by the time it filters down to the bottom of the shaft there
is not much left of it.

Around the central shaft are two tracks that each support a high-speed
mass-transit vehicle that quickly and efficiently moves people up and
down the spiraling platform that rings the shaft.

The top level is where most of the housing is located, sprawling out
around the central shaft on three sides like a mostly vertical suburbia.
The fourth side of the shaft is where the spaceport is located.

As one gets deeper into the shaft, the light becomes much harsher, and
more artificial. By the time one reaches the bottom, the sunlight is
nothing more than a spot and all usable light is issued from artificial
sources. The bottom of the shaft is littered with tons of garbage and
discarded refuse from all of the higher levels of the city.

## Features/Places of Note

## Government

Achilles is operated by a counsil of officers from all of the locally
operating corporations. This counsil debates policy in an open forum to
decide policy which is then ratified into action by majority vote by
those in attendance. This body defers to the
[Conglomerate](The_Conglomerate "wikilink") and can be overridden by
their wishes, although this never happens publicly. Because of its
importance as a manufacturing resource, the Conglomerate often guides
Achilles governmental affairs with a not too subtle hand, ensuring that
the city will be able to provide for the needs of the solar system.

## History

## Spoilers

<spoiler text="Spoiler">In 'The First Key of Kalijor' a major scene
takes place in Achilles, during which, Riana defeats the control collar
that Xavier placed on her. She and Willhelmina then make a harrowing
escape from the bowels of the city on a motorcycle while under fire from
several flying vehicles. </spoiler>

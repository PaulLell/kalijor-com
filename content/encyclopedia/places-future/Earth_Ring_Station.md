## Vital Statistics

**Name:** The Earth Ring Station
**Other Names:** Ring Station, 'Earth'
**Location:** Built in geo-synchronous orbit around
[Earth](Earth "wikilink")
**Permanent Population:** 5 billion
**Transient Population:** 10 million to 100 million souls
**Imports:** Food, Raw materials both organic and non-organic,
prefabricated starship components, entertainment.
**Exports:** Medical supplies, Weapons, Starships (both sub-luminal and
super-luminal).

## Description

It consists of three massive rings that intersect at perpendicular
angles to one another, perfectly quartering the planet. At each
intersection of these tubes is a massive node where megacities have been
built, each capable of housing hundreds of millions of people.

The megacities are each self-sufficient with the exception of food
production. While they grow impressive amounts of food themselves in
hydroponic gardens, it is not nearly enough for them to support their
entire populations. As such the primary import of the Earth Ring Station
is food.

Power is generated through a combination of fusion generators,
photovoltaic cells on the surface of the station, and a unique fluid
system that generates power by circulating fluid throughout the rings of
the station by the heating/cooling convection action of the sun on the
surface of the station.

The rings of the station are used for the dual purpose of docking ships,
both large and small, and fabrication/industrial activity, as well as
additional housing, mostly for transients although many permanent
residents choose to live in the rings as well since that allows them to
stay closer to their work.

The normal, permanent population of the Earth Ring Station is in the
neighborhood of five billion, making it by far the most populace center
for human habitation in known space.

Each of the megacity nodes is equipped with everything anyone could want
including housing, schools, recreation, shopping, public parks, and
anything else a person might need. An additional, long-unused feature of
each of these cities are the six orbital elevator shafts that were once,
more than five-hundred years ago, used to efficiently move large and
small payloads from the surface of the Earth to the ring station. Most
people no longer even remember the existence of these facilities, let
alone where they might actually be located.

## Description

The domed city of Tranquility is the largest city/structure on the
surface of the moon, being more than five-hundred square miles in size
and playing host to around five-hundred million permanent residents. At
any given time there may be as many as fifty million additional people
in the city on business, or simply visiting.

The crater walls that make up the outside edge of the city house
thousands of air-locks and pressureizable hangars of all sizes in order
to accommodate all manner of vessel, although all commercial passenger
transports use the massive spaceport in order to get in and out of the
city.

The weaker gravity field of the moon is amplified through the use of
gravity levelers that increase the field strength to 1G (Earth normal)
gravity, where most habitable locations are kept in order to keep people
able to easily transition from location to location without incurring
additional health risks.

While there are some manufacturing and agricultural facilities in
Tranquility, the city is mostly residential and administrative in
nature.

## Features/Places of Note

Of note in the city of Tranquility is a public/national park that has
never been developed. In fact its surface has remained untouched for
more than a thousand years. This spot is the landing site of the
original Eagle space craft that made humanity's first tentative steps on
another world.

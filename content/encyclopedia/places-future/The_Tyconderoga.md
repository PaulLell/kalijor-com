## Description

The Tyconderoga is a large space station built and occupied by
[Solidarity Online](Solidarity_Online "wikilink"). The station is
positioned in the L1 Lagrange Point between [Earth](Earth "wikilink")
and [Luna](Luna "wikilink"), and has been the sole facility of the
corporation since it was brought online.

The Tyconderoga is a top of the line facility that acts as both home,
and work place for the majority of Solidarity Online's employees and
their immidiate families. There are a variety of off-site personnel, but
most of them work from private residences as Solidarity Online does not
officially own any property outside of this station.

Facilities include a massive, fully equipped gym with a quarter mile
track, several olympic size swimming pools, sparring rings, a
multi-screen cinema, large open market area, and numerous five-star
eateries. The top level of teh station is covered in a large,
transparent, geodesic dome that allows an unprecidented view of the
stars, Earth, and Luna, all at once. This Promenade deck is where the
market and most of the restaraunts are located, with most of the other
recreational facilities (gyms, theaters, etc.) located immidiately below
this level. Under these facilities are the residential areas of the
station, which include school/educational, and health care facilities
for the station's myriad residents.

The heart of the station, well away from any external bulkheads, or
access, is the 'game deck'. This is where all of teh computers that
operate Solidarity Online's various MMO games are located. Almost 80% of
teh power consumed on the station is used on these levels, yet less than
10% of employees ever see behind the thickly armored doors that keep
these systems secure. Below the 'game deck' are teh various other
computer operations of the coorporation, security, finance, development,
and the like. Below that are the operational levels where most of the
power generation and environmental systems are located, as well as the
loading, unloading, and storage of cargo and supplies. The lowest levels
house the administrative operations, and the bottom-most point of the
station is another, much smaller geodesic dome that houses teh office of
[Xavier Quinn](Xavier_Quinn "wikilink"), the corporation's CEO.

Like most space stations, the Tyconderoga is a large, self-contained
city all unto itself, and even generates/grows most of its own
vegetables, herbs, and a large amount of yeasts and algea that is
processed into nutrient rich foodstuffs for the local residents. There
is still much in the way of imported supplies, however, as variety is
important, and not everyone enjoyes eating pure protein all of the time.

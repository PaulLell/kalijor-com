# Description

One of the major Martian cities, Hector is located near the eastern edge of the
Valles Marineris, a three-thousand mile long, mile deep trench that hugs the
planet’s equator. Near the western edge of the same fissure lies the sister city
of Achilles . The two cities are now in the process of enclosing the vast
expanse of trench between them, nearly eighteen hundred miles, and terra-forming
the floor of the trench into a rain forest. Hector is the agricultural capital
of Mars, covering hundreds of miles of the surface of the pockmarked planet.
Very little of the city extends far below ground as their livelihood relies
almost solely on the sun’s rays shining through their many domes and windows.

Hector is the agricultural capital of the Sol system. Its massive, sprawling,
hydroponic fields cover thousands of square miles. In reality the city is more
of a conglomeration of interconnected, stand-alone farms, each contained within
its own structure and linked together by a series of tubes and tunnels that
allow easy transport from module to module. However, in the event of any
catastrophic systems failures, each 'farm' can be cut off so as to keep its
precious, life-giving produce safe.

# Features/Places of Note

Hector has not one large, central spaceport, but rather, due to its sprawling
size, it has established dozens of smaller spaceports scattered across its area.
This allows materials to be more easily and quickly loaded up for transport
off-world.

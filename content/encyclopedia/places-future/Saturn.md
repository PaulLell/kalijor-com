## Description

The Saturn community is very similar to [Jupiter](Jupiter "wikilink") in
that it consists of numerous basses and stations that reside on the
surface of many of the planet’s moons, and in orbit around the planet
itself. The Saturn community’s primary export is noble gasses such as
xenon and argon which are used as fuel in Ion drive systems that are one
of the mainstays of intrasystem transportation.

Recently, several start-up companies have begun trying to build an
ancillary ship yard in Saturn space in an attempt to reduce the cost of
starship construction, a large portion of which is due to hauling and
processing of raw materials. Thus far they have set up materials
processing facilities in orbit around the planet itself and are
dedicating those facilities’ output to the construction of their ship
yards. The conglomerate has thus far kept their hands out of this new
business, preferring to watch and see what happens. As long as the money
keeps flowing out of the system they don’t much care what goes on there,
unless it becomes a problem in some way. There is one primary space
station in orbit around Saturn where all shipments are collated together
and inventoried before they are shipped back to
[Earth](Earth_Ring_Station "wikilink"). This is also where all imports
arrive before they are divided up and shipped out to the smaller
facilities.

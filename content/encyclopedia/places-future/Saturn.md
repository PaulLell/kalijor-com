# Description

The Saturn community is very similar to [Jupiter](../jupiter) in that it
consists of numerous basses and stations that reside on the surface of many of
the planet’s moons, and in orbit around the planet itself. The Saturn
community’s primary export is noble gasses such as xenon and argon which are
used as fuel in Ion drive systems that are one of the mainstays of intrasystem
transportation.

Recently, several start-up companies have begun trying to build an ancillary
ship yard in Saturn space in an attempt to reduce the cost of starship
construction, a large portion of which is due to hauling and processing of raw
materials. Thus far they have set up materials processing facilities in orbit
around the planet itself and are dedicating those facilities’ output to the
construction of their ship yards. The conglomerate has thus far kept their hands
out of this new business, preferring to watch and see what happens. As long as
the money keeps flowing out of the system they don’t much care what goes on
there, unless it becomes a problem in some way. There is one primary space
station in orbit around Saturn where all shipments are collated together and
inventoried before they are shipped back to [Earth](../earth_ring_station). This
is also where all imports arrive before they are divided up and shipped out to
the smaller facilities.

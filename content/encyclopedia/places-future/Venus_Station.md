## Description

While the Earth Ring Station is the largest man-made structure in teh
Sol System, The Venus Station is by far the oldest, and densest. What
started off as a simple way-station in orbit around Venus has, over the
past 5 centuries, transformed into a small, artificial moon\! The core
of the station is hollow, and attached to a large shaft that connects it
to empty space outside. This shaft is home to thousands of landing pads
and docking stations for cargo and transport ships of all sizes, while
the hollow core serves as a zero-gravity construction yard for ships
ranging in size from simple shuttles, to the large capital ships used as
military flagships.

The shaft and shipyards are kept pressurized, which allows workers to
build vessels in zero-G but not have to worry about wearing pressure
suits or other zero-atmosphere protective gear. This atmosphere,
combined with the minor variations in gravity from place to place along
its length, creates eddies, currents, and even dangerous wind storms all
along the opening. These winds create navigational hazzards that make
traversing the shaft difficult for some pilots who may never fly ships
in atmospheres of any kind, let alone in wind storms. The other, and
more desireable effect of this, is that all along the shaft there is a
continual supply of fresh, cool air.

There are hundreds of hotels, bars, and other hospitality facilities all
along the shaft, and some of the best shopping deals in teh system can
be found here as well, provided shoppers have weeks to peruse the
literally thousands of nooks and crannies that shops can be squeeezed
into.

The interior of the station is composed of layer upon layer of corridors
and cavities, some of which contain whole cities filled with actual
buildings (with metal ceilings overhead and walls surrounding them). A
series of public transportation systems, consisting of monorails,
escilators, and elevators allow travel between levels of teh station,
but can make navigation extremely difficult, and even hazardous, to
those who don't know exactly where they are going. In fact, many people
can, and do, go their entire lives without seeing any more of teh
station than the small, self-contained city they are born in\!

In terms of demographics, the closer one gets to teh surface of the
station, the wealthier they tend to be, with the one exception of those
that live around the very core. Skilled shipwrights make an excellent
living, and like to stay close to their projects, so there is a high
degree of wealth concentrated in and around the core as well.

## Description

Originally purchased and furnished by Solidarity Online for use as
housing for agents on assignment or in need of a safe house. Daray was
given use of the home and its facilities when Xavier sent her to
Tranquility to get to the bottom of the Aegis Online plan to kill or
lobotomize millions of Kalijor players. After the mission was completed
and debts were being settled, Xavier signed the deed to the penthouse
over to Daray as an apology for the Skinsuit being permanently bonded to
her body, preventing her from being returned to her original form
through any known genetic engineering.

The penthouse is on the 32nd floor of a residential building less than
ten minute's walk from the Tranquility spaceport and is worth an
estimated fifty million credits.

## Features/Places of Note

Facilities include a commercial kitchen, a game room, a top of the line
theater room, three bedrooms, a library, and office space, living room
with wet bar, three bathrooms and a sunken/pit couch with a holographic
display built into the central table, allowing for board games, videos,
fire places, and even computer input/output to take place there.

Special amenities, not known to anyone but Daray, Lana, and other agents
of Solidarity Online include a top of the line quantum computer cluster
with direct access to a dedicated sub-space transceiver, VPN tunnel to
Solidarity Online data warehouses, and enough processing power to run
both APRIL and SEAN's programs with muscle to spare. Several armories,
and hidden equipment lockers that are kept loaded for bear and able to
supply equipment for nearly any field operation, and diagnostic
laboratory equipment of the highest caliber.

Daray and Lana now make their home here, with frequent trips to see
Lana's father and time away for business, but the house is kept clean
and monitored by the full-time, around the clock building staff who have
been hand-picked and security screened, and draw their salaries from
Solidarity Online.

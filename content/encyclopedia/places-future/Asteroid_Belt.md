# Description

‘The Belt’ refers to the community that lives and works in the asteroid belt
that lay between Jupiter and Saturn. As such, it is not really a physical
location, so much as a a series of cobbled-together space stations/habitats
amongst the asteroids. Usually, but not always, there is a path cleared to the
facility so that large ships can get in and out to halul in supplies and haul
out mined materials.

# Features/Places of Note

# Government

This is not a large, cohesive community like most of the other planets maintain,
but rather a great number of tiny stations and bases that all operate
independently of one another. Each station is run by a family with the head of
household typically calling the shots within their particular operation. Each
month the [Conglomerate](../../corporations/the_conglomerate) sets a quota for
‘The Belt’ to meet and then the heads of households meet to divvy up the work
load in order to maximize resources and profits. Occasionally there is a small
skirmish between households but usually they are too interested in meeting quota
to be dealing with petty squabbles. ‘The Belt’ is easily the best place for
anyone who is trying to avoid detection to secret themselves away. Most of the
families will harbor refugees for a price and the decentralized nature of the
community makes it neigh impossible to locate anyone not wishing to be found.

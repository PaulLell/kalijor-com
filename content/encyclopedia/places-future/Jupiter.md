## Description

The Jupiter community is not one single settlement or location but
rather numerous bases and stations that reside on the surface of many of
the planet’s moons, and in orbit around the planet itself. Jupiter’s
primary function is the mining of rare gasses and minerals used in
starship production among other products. Most everything extracted from
the Jupiter system is transported directly to the Earth-ring station
specifically for use in the corporate ship-yards there. There is one
primary space station in orbit around Jupiter where all shipments are
collated together and inventoried before they are shipped back to Earth.
This is also where all imports arrive before they are divided up and
shipped out to the smaller facilities.

# Description

The Jupiter community is not one single settlement or location but rather
numerous bases and stations that reside on the surface of many of the planet’s
moons, and in orbit around the planet itself. Jupiter’s primary function is the
mining of rare gasses and minerals used in starship production among other
products. Most everything extracted from the Jupiter system is transported
directly to the Earth-ring station specifically for use in the corporate
ship-yards there. There is one primary space station in orbit around Jupiter
where all shipments are collated together and inventoried before they are
shipped back to Earth.  This is also where all imports arrive before they are
divided up and shipped out to the smaller facilities.

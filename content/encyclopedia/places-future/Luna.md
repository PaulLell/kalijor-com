# Description

The moon is now by far the most populace world in the Sol system. Its cities are
domed enclosures that are built into the massive craters on the surface. Most of
the cities are so large that they have developed their own internal weather
systems. The capital city on the moon is Tranquility, which rests in the
three-crater group known as the sea of tranquility. The total population of the
moon is in the neighborhood of two-hundred to three-hundred billion people.

Earth's moon is by far the next most populace body in the Sol system since it
has been steadily colonized almost since the human race began stretching out
beyond the bounds of their home world.

There are dozens of domed cities built on the surface of the moon, most of which
have been built into existing craters, a practice that, while having no real
structural or other engineering purpose, was how they began building them
initially and so the practice simply continued as more and more facilities were
constructed.

While most of the structures on the moon's surface are cities, there are a great
many that are agricultural or fabrication oriented, large factories or
greenhouses.

Travel between the Earth Ring Station and the moon is relatively quick, with
most ships being able to make the trip in around four hours.

# Features/Places of Note

The largest structure on the surface of the moon is easily the city of
Tranquility, which is built inside the massive crater of the same name.

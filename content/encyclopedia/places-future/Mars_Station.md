**Name:** Mars Station
**Other Names:**

**Permanent Population:**
**Transient Population:**
**Imports:** Nearly everything, although they are supported with food
and goods from Mars directly.
**Exports:** None. The station exists merely to act as an intermediary
for Martian commerce.

## Description

The Mars space station is the oldest original station still in operation
today. It has been retrofitted and overhauled more times than anyone can
remember and continues to be modified to this day. Its sole purpose for
existence is to act as a go-between for imports/exports to and from Mars
proper, and as a place for tired spacers to stop and unwind a bit
between trips. There is a thriving black market on Mars Station that the
[Conglomerate](The_Conglomerate "wikilink") continues to ignore due to
the [Earth’s](Earth_Ring_Station "wikilink") and
[Luna’s](Luna "wikilink") dependence upon Martian exports of food and
goods.

The Mars Station is now more of a third-world country than a center of
commerce. Living conditions for most of the population, which numbers
into the millions, are terrible at best. The environment is unclean, the
infrastructure for waste disposal and clean water distribution is in
constant need of repair and power is available in some areas only
intermittently.

The hallways are filled with merchant's tents that are set up alongside
ramshackle tents and lean-to's where those that are unable to afford
their own housing make their homes. The people that live here re
generally of two different types, the squalidly poor, unable to even
look someone else in the eyes, and the immensely rich, unwilling to give
anyone else the time of day.

## History

The Mars Station is a large space station that was built in
geosynchronous orbit around the red planet hundreds of years ago. The
original purpose of the station was to allow larger vessels to dock in
orbit and allow smaller vessels to haul goods to and from the planet at
a much reduced cost. It quickly grew into a center of commerce for the
Sol system since nearly all food was grown on the surface of the planet.

As technology changed the cost and value of space travel, and made much
smaller, faster, more affordable ships capable of hauling more and more
cargo, the station was used less and less for its original midway
purpose and more for general habitation.

As the years progressed, the station was added to and modified to
accommodate more and more people until it now no longer even resembles
its original design.

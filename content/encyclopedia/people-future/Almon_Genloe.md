# General Description

Almon is a discerning businessman, with a pronounced ability to keep business,
pleasure, and personal life, all in their own separate compartments. He dresses
like a millionaire (which he is, several times over), treates his employees with
respect, and his enemies, even more so. For Almon, there is no rapture, no
pleasure, no indulgence greater, than a worthy adversary.

There are few people in Neo-Tokyo as powerful as Almon. He controls a vast,
underground empire of ciminal activity, blackmarket operations, illicit
shipping, and even slave-trade. There are, however, some boundaries, even Almon
won't cross. He won't sell drugs or other mind/body altering substances, and he
most certainly will never underestimate an adversary. He likes to play chess,
not checkers, and as a result, he is regularly planning several moves ahead of
his current activities, and while he has rarely had to use one, he always has a
contingency plan in place.

# Skills of Note

# Equipment of Note

Almon has a huge amount of military-grade firepower and personnel at his
command, and is not above getting his own hands dirty, should the situation call
for it. Although, he tends to work toward outsmarting his opponents, rather than
out- muscling them.

Status: Deceased at the end of the Third Key of Kalijor, but Alive and well
again by the end of the Fifth Key of Kalijor.  In the third novel,
[Exodus](../../people-kalijor/exodus) jumps in front of a sword that was thrown
at someone else. He is impaled by the blade and through some as yet unknown
means, the trauma fed back through the system and killed Jax. It is interesting
to note however, that before his last trip into Kalijor, Jax made a copy of as
much of his personality and memories as he could.  Imprinting them on a copy of
his spell book in Kalijor and imbuing it with a life of its own and a
personality very similar to his. The big question is, how did he know to do
this? Was he expecting this outcome, or just taking precautions?  At any rate,
by the conclusion of the series in the Fifth Key of Kalijor, he is alive and
well again, living in Kalijor with Katrina in Pandoria.

## Spoilers

<spoiler text="Status">Status: Deceased at the end of the Third Key of
Kalijor, but Alive and well again by the end of the Fifth Key of
Kalijor.</spoiler>
<spoiler text="The Measure of a Man"> In the third novel,
[Exodus](Exodus "wikilink") jumps in front of a sword that was thrown at
someone else. He is impaled by the blade and through some as yet unknown
means, the trauma fed back through the system and killed Jax. It is
interesting to note however, that before his last trip into Kalijor, Jax
made a copy of as much of his personality and memories as he could.
Imprinting them on a copy of his spell book in Kalijor and imbuing it
with a life of its own and a personality very similar to his. The big
question is, how did he know to do this? Was he expecting this outcome,
or just taking precautions?
At any rate, by the conclusion of the series in the Fifth Key of
Kalijor, he is alive and well again, living in Kalijor with Katrina in
Pandoria.</spoiler>

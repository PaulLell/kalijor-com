(Noo-e-ree Kat-nee-oh) A Nuiri-Qatnio is the extremely rare occurrence
of a child of a Psi-line and a Gene-line character, that inherits the
majority of the genetic traits/abilities/features from BOTH of their
parents. Most Nuiri-Qatnios die within 1D4 years of being born due to
the extreme nature of the forces at work within their bodies. Those that
do survive, usually have a difficult life ahead of them. Nuiri-Qatnios
are feared by most people for their abilities and appearance, and to
make matters worse, they are often afflicted with some form of mental
problems. Nuiri-Qatnios are only able to reproduce with other
Nuiri-Qatnios and there has not yet been a recorded instance of any
child of two Nuiri-Qatnios actually having been born alive, they are all
either still-born, or miscarried early on in the pregnancy.

These individuals possess a massive array of abilities, both genetic and
psionic in nature, and are often physically extreme in appearance
(meaning they have more than just the minor cosmetic alterations going
on, usually extra limbs, armored skin, horns, tails, wings, etc.).

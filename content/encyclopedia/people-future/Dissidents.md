title: Dissidents
---

Any person or persons who have either chosen, or have been forced to live 'off
the grid'. These people are not citizens of [The
Conglomerate](../../corporations/the_conglomerate) and are treated as lower than
second-class people by any Conglomerate personnel who may encounter them. It is
technically illegal for Dissidents to enter, leave, or simpley be, inside any
Conglomerate facility or vessel. Dissidents have no rights, no privelages, and
are unable to own property, have jobs, spend money, or interact with
Conglomerate citizens in any way.

The majority of teh Dissident population lives as a fairly tightly-knit
community within the the [Asteroid Belt](../../places-future/asteroid_belt) in a
society that is rather condescendingly known as the
[Dregs](../../places-future/dregs).

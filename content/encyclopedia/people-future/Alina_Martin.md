# Vital Statistics

**Physical Description:** Alina Martin has a runner's body, which she works
regularly to maintain. Her naturally bright green eyes come from her father's
side of the family, and when she graduated high school, she purchased
gene-therapy to change her hair color to match. Subsequent events have seen
several additional changes made to her body, many of which were without her
conscent, while she was under the mental control of Turin. Her ears are both
pierced mutiple times, as are her left eyebrow, right nostril (exterior), and
right lower lip. The piercings are all simple, seamless, silver rings of various
sizes that are made of starship hull grade material and thus, can not be removed
without seriously damaging her (as is evidenced by the large amount of scar
tissue on either side of her septum where she had one of the piercings removed).

# General Description

She is strong, quick-thinking, intelligent and always thinking of the next five
moves in the game. After a mugging attempt on Alina and her friend,
[Daray](../daray_dare_bowen), she was paralyzed from the waist down by a
vibro-knife wound to the gut. A deal made with [Xavier Quinn](../xavier_quinn)
saw the damage repaired, along with the amplifying of her senses, and the
installation of a cranial computer system and sub-space transceiver that
prevents her from being closer than about ninty feet from Daray.

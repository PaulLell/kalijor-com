## General Description

Gregory Shantal is a mercenary that has earned himself a well deserved
reputation as a brutal and efficient soldier. He hires himself out to
the highest bidder and does not care what kind of work they ask him to
do. Nothing is beneath him, especially if the price is right.

More than ninety percent of his body has been replaced with artificial,
enhanced cybernetic parts, including both arms and legs, all of his
bones in his chest cavity as well as all major organs. His skull is
artificial and protects his brain against shock and impact trauma. He
has had many new items added to his cybernetic body, including radio
transceivers, targeting computers, concealed weapons of various types,
computer ICE breaking equipment and more. He is a ruthless and cunning
warrior with an aptitude for martial arts and melee weapons. He is also
known for his unrelenting pursuit of those who have bested him in
combat, whether fairly or not.

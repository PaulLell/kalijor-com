Psi-Line Humans are those that have undergone extensive modification through
genetic engineering or are the children of thusly-engineered individuals. The
end result of the genetic engineering is that the Psi-line humans have developed
psionic powers to some extent. The range of their powers varies greatly from one
individual to the next, but none of them has anything less than minor psionic
aptitude.

The genetic modifications these individuals or their parents have undergone have
almost all centered around the mind and other neurological systems of the body.
While they may have also had physical changes made to alter their appearance,
the majority of their differences are internal, having to do with organ
structures and brain composition. However, they tend to be much less physically
impressive than normal humans due to the amount of modifications that have been
made in order to strengthen their mental prowess.

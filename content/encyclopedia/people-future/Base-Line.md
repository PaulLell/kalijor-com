Base-line Humans are people that have less than 10% cybernetic parts (not
counting cosmetic alterations that are easily removed) or less than 1% genetic
alterations. These people are about as regular as is possible with no real
special abilities or powers to speak of. Base-line humans make up the majority
by far, more than 90% of the known population of the Sol system).

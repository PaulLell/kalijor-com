## General Description

Willhelmina is a twenty-four year old woman who has spent more than half
of her life almost continuously connected to Kalijor, in order to keep
the character of [Katrina](Katrina_Annwyn_Thorindal "wikilink") as real
as possible to [Riana](Riana_Shandra_Thorindal "wikilink").

Willhelmina is an orphan who was adopted as a ward of Solidarity Online,
the company that operates the game world of Kalijor, specifically for
the purpose of monitoring Riana in the game world. She has an extremely
strong emotional bond with Riana (having spent more than half of her
life with her) and was the person that originally suggested giving Riana
a real body to house her consciousness and rescue both her and the world
of Kalijor from a hard crash resulting from Rianaâ€™s development into a
sentient being.

## Skills of Note

<spoiler text="Marksmanship">Recognizing that it is impossible for her
to keep up with Riana physically, Willhelmina turned her 'work skills'
development down a different road. Pouring all of her free time into the
weapons range and ballistic sciences and armoring/gunsmithing. Combined
with some latent natural talent for the science, she has turned herself
into an exemplary marksman and a gunsmith without peer. While she knows
Riana could very easily replicate most of what she does, she also
realizes that her sister has little to no desire to do so, preferring to
stay in close combat range, or avoid a fight altogether. As a result,
Willhelmina has taken up the mantle of the team sniper and long-range
support specialist by the fourth book in the main story arc.

At one point, Riana mentions Willhelmina's skills to Vincent and Niko,
describing one of her custom made weapons and its ammunition, which is a
25mm hard jacketed, armor piercing round with an electrically fired,
oxygen impregnated shaped charge cartridge and a secondary stage
'ram-jet' solid rocket propulsion motor. Later in the series, she is
seen making pinpoint shots with this rifle at ranges upwards of two
miles, and in 'The Aegis Protocol' she is seen using it to support Riana
and Daray in an assault on an Aegis Online research facility, during
which she nearly removes one of Anja's hands from more than a mile
away.</spoiler>

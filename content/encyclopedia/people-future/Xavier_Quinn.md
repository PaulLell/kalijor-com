**Physical Description:** He stands just over six feet tall and has dark
hair that falls to the middle of his back and is always restrained in a
pony tail and very well maintained, never a single strand out of place.
He wears a well trimmed Mustache that falls down on either side of his
mouth, merging seamlessly into his equally well trimmed beard leaving
his jaw and face free of hair except around the chin and under the nose.
He is powerfully built, able to handle himself more than adequately in a
fight, and as smart as anyone has ever come.

## General Description

Xavier Quinn is the force behind Solidarity Online. He is the man
holding all of the cards and manipulating all of the strings. He makes
no secret of his power or his position, although he is a consummate
manipulator.

He is devious, conniving, cunning, and never accepts defeat in the long
term, although he is amenable to loosing a battle if it gains him a
victory in the war. He always dresses impeccably, in only the finest of
hand made silk suits, speaks using proper English, and proper names, and
has never been known to be out of sorts, even under what most would
consider to be dire circumstances.

## Vital Statistics

**Full Name:** Daray (Dare) Bowen ![DaraySolo.png](/images/DaraySolo.png
"DaraySolo.png") **Aliases:**
**Avatar/Player:**
**Occupation:** Pincher (corporate espionage expert)
**Date of Birth:** July 18, 3047
**Height:** 4’9”
**Weight:** 118 lbs (looks like she couldn’t weigh more than 90 lbs)
**Hair Color:** Strawberry Blonde
**Eye Color:** Dark Cobalt Blue
**Physical Description:** Short and almost scary thin, Daray is actually
a lot tougher than she seems. She has a look about her that is at once
very pleasing to the eye and at the same time engineered to fade quickly
from memory. She wears her hair in a short style that hangs straight
down from her head like a curtain covering her ears. It is short in the
back (barely covering much below the base of her skull) and long in the
front (hanging down to below her shoulders). Her dark, cobalt eyes are
the only thing about her that tends to stick in people’s memories
despite her obvious attractiveness. She always wears a skin-tight,
rubbery catsuit that covers her from her neck down, even sealing in her
fingers and toes. This ‘Skinsuit’ is able to morph and mould itself into
a variety of shapes, colors, and densities, allowing her to simulate any
sort of clothing up to and including battle armor and even a sealed
space suit when necessary, however it will ALWAYS have a rubbery look,
feel, and shine to it no matter what shape or color it takes on.

## General Description

Daray, or ‘Dare’ as she likes to be called, is the result of an extreme
amount of genetic and cybernetic re-engineering. Formerly a man known as
Darren Erricson, Daray was born when one of Darren's jobs went bad and
he ended up covered in someone's genetic engineering experiment. Working
a deal with Solidarity Online to save himself, they provided him with
facilities and support to see the experiment through to completion,
since it had gone too far to be stopped or reversed. Daray helped
uncover and stop a plot against Solidarity Online's Kalijor MMO and has
since become a free agent, carrying on with the espionage game using her
new physiology and skills to some great effect. Dare has been
genetically enhanced in so many ways that she really isn't even human
any more, with reinforced bones, increased muscle density, highly
enhanced senses, reflexes, and speed. Her strangest talents are the
ability to regenerate from almost any wound, including lost/severed
limbs, and even a bullet wound to the head. She is also able to project
a limited number of bio-plasma blasts from a series of glands concealed
under the skin of her forearms. The last major modification to her body
has been the addition of a super computer that has been squeezed into
her skull and is home to an extremely advanced Artificial Intelligence
called [APRIL](APRIL "wikilink").

## Skills of Note

As a long-time Pincher, Daray has developed considerable talent in the
areas of clandestine movement/sneaking, defeating locks both electrical
and mechanical, and hacking computer systems. She is an accomplished
Traceur (practitioner of Parkour/Free-Running) and a Class 3 hand to
hand combatant (with leanings toward Class 2) in the rather flamboyant
art of Capoeria.

With the assistance of Solidarity Online Daray has learned more about
cloak and dagger activities than she ever wanted but is able to now
recognize and lose a tail with efficiency as well as having an ability
to properly tail someone with minimum chance of detection. She can
operate most general vehicles and is able to passably pilot small
spacecraft (although she is by no means rated to handle emergency
maneuvers or combat flying) and can operate most forms of communication
equipment.

With her background growing up with two super-star Digerati and APRIL's
assistance, Daray is a more than accomplished computer hacker, able to
circumvent most security measures and enter all but the most well
protected networks and systems with relative ease. Her ability to
operate independently from, or in conjunction with APRIL while hacking
means that they can focus their efforts to defeat security twice as
quickly, or attack a problem from different angles simultaneously,
putting more pressure on system defenses/protectors.

Dealing with unscrupulous people and corporate officials for most of her
life, Daray is also a fairly shrewd, if abrupt, negotiator with a fair
understanding of corporate politics and sociological structures. While
she generally wants nothing to do with such things, she is able to
understand them and often uses them the gain the upper hand in
negotiations, or for leverage.

Daray's sarcastic wit, while not technically a skill, is a tool that she
uses, mostly subconsciously, to both keep others at arm's length and off
balance. She's found that making sure nobody can predict or expect what
she will do next means that she can get away with much and remain
secluded from the world and the dangers she perceives in deep personal
connections.

## Equipment of Note

Daray's normal compliment of gear includes a good, high-quality ODN
patch cable, a set of high-quality mechanical lock picks, and her trusty
bastón.

Her bastón are a set of alloy sticks, approximately 24 inches in length
and about an inch in diameter that she carries in a sheath, slung across
her back. She uses them as both offensive and defensive weapons, as pry
bars, door shims, and whatever else she may need. As simple metal
sticks, they do not cause her much trouble at Conglomerate checkpoints
or customs kiosks and she is able to take them almost everywhere with
her as they are perceived by others as being less dangerous than a
standard sidearm, which is legal to carry. One end of each of her bastón
is able to be unscrewed from the shaft to reveal a tiny hollow inside
where she keeps three platinum slips, making for a total of six slips
worth approximately 12,000 Conglomerate credits. Her emergency fund,
should she ever need money and not have access to her credit accounts or
other physical currency.

At her home in Tranquility, Daray has an arsenal the likes of which Ares
has never conceived, consisting of ballistic and energy weapons,
explosives, ammunition, armor, tactical gear, sensory equipment for
surveillance and tracking and much more. It was all provided by
Solidarity Online and was never removed when possession of the apartment
was transferred to her, although she rarely uses any of it, preferring
to rely instead on her skills, abilities, natural talents, and the
simplest tools possible.

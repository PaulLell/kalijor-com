"DarrenSolo.png") **Aliases:**
**Avatar/Player:**
**Occupation:** Private Courier
**Date of Birth:** December 25, 3027
**Height:** 6’4”
**Weight:** 180 lbs
**Hair Color:** Dark Brown
**Eye Color:** Hazel-green
**Physical Description:** Physically Darren is in amazing shape. He has
the toned body of a tri-athlete due to his regularly Parkouring around
the Venus Station. He keeps his dark brown hair short and manageable so
that he can be up and about, and looking his best, at a moment’s notice.
He tends to wear pretty basic attire, jeans/kakis/cargo pants and
T-shirts/hoodies, mostly to keep his appearance as forgettable as
possible. He is handsome, clean shaven, and takes excellent care of
himself.

## General Description

Darren is rarely at home, preferring instead to partake in an active
nightlife and is adept at romancing the ladies with flowers, and
chivalrous demonstrations. When around other guys he tends to brag a
little bit, although he is also very quick to put his money where his
mouth is, and regularly wins high-dollar wagers performing seemingly
impossible physical demonstrations. He is an accomplished Traceur and
has a few years of Capoeira under his belt as well. At his heart he is
an honorable man who tends to always do the right thing, even if he will
never let you hear the end of what it is costing him.

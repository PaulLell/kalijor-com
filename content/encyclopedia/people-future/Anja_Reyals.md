weight which is caused by her unique body. She has long, tapered ears, light
blue eyes and dark blue hair that, when unrestrained, reaches the small of her
back. With the exception of her eye and hair color, and the absence of any

# General Description

Anja is mean, spiteful, quick to anger, and quicker to start a fight.

Anja is a cyborg of extremely advanced design. Her bones are a composite of a
titanium-like alloy wrapped around a honeycomb of carbon-fiber. Her muscle
tissue is an advanced kevlar-like material and her skin is grown around
interwoven layers of reactive fibrous armor. Her senses, muscles, and reflexes
have all been tuned to their utmost capabilities, well beyond human potential
and that of most cybernetic technology of the day. Her mind is interfaced
directly with an advanced computer system that increases her comprehension,
retention, and recall capabilities as well.

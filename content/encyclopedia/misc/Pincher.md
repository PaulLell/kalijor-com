title: Pincher
---

Pinchers are the future equivilent of cat burglers. These individuals are
skilled in many areas of subterfuge, hacking, breaking and entering, and other,
similar activities. Pinchers are master thieves, able to break through the
toughest of physical security systems and most computer security as well. While
their computer skills do not extend into the same realms as
[Digerati](../digerati) they are still quite adept. While a good Digerati can
break through sophisticated security and hop across networks and systems with
the greatest of ease, the average Pincher will instead dance through the
physical security measures to get inside where the computer security is nowhere
near as strong as it is outside.

Where Digerati are the cyber samurai of the modern world, Pinchers are more like
the Ronin, breaking down security and reveling in the challenge of the
acquisition, all for the piles of money they get paid to do so.

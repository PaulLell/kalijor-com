## Description

The Forest of Brume is an ancient forest that dominates more than a
third of the light side of Kalijor. It rests between the Northern and
Southern Planes of Serenity, runs up to the Uraval Mountains on the east
side and the Great Sea to the west. In the center of the forest rests
the Great Inland Sea, a body of water that would take a week to cross in
any direction and in the center of which is an island where one of the
five ziggurats of Kalijor rests. The areas of the forest that butt up
against the Great Inland Sea are by far the oldest, and home to the
largest of the Brume Trees and the oldest of the creatures that live in
the forest. There are a few roads through the eastern and western
portions of the forest, but none through the central areas. In the
eastern central portion of the forest, just off the main road there is
the portal to the elven city of Pandoria, and in the central western
portion of the forest is the monolith tower that is the Magic Academy.
Also along the coast on the western edge of the forest there are several
fishing villages where hundreds of people have taken up residence and
make a living providing sea food to most of the rest of Kalijor.

The Forest of Brume is home to a myriad of creatures and animals
including bears, goblins, wolves, snakes, a few large cats, giant
spiders and even a clan of werepanthers. The forest has a layer of mist,
lending to its name, that constantly covers the ground to about a foot
depth, making it difficult to see where you are placing your feet as you
move through the region. This makes it easy to step on any number of
small creatures but also plays on people's nerves more because of the
constant sense of movement travelers feel as said small creatures dart
out of the way, just out of sight in the mist.

The Forest of Brume is the oldest standing forest on the central
continent of Kalijor. It is populated almost entirely by Brume Trees
which are a slow growing, dense, long fiber hard wood that is perfect
for weapons and structural members in construction. However one of the
less pleasing qualities of the wood is that is constantly exudes a
thick, grey-white mist or fog. The forest floor is constantly obscured
by this mist making it easy to trip over roots or other small obstacles.
This property seems to stay with the wood, even years after it has been
cut and worked into a desired form. This property makes the wood a
seldom used choice for most construction projects and most adventurers
find it more than a little disconcerting to have themselves constantly
surrounded by a thick fog so it is also rarely used in weapon
construction.

## Features/Places of Note

The forest gets older and older the closer one gets to the center where
some of the trees can measure their age in millennia. In the heart of
the forest is the Great Inland Sea.

On the east side of the Great Inland Sea, in the younger forest, lay the
portal to Pandoria.

On the west side of the Great Inland Sea, almost on the shore of the
Endless Ocean is the monolithic Magic Academy.

The forest plays host to some of the oldest known living creatures on
Kalijor, as well as some of the most powerful. Most of these creatures
live deeper in the forest, but occasionally they can be seen by unwary
travelers that have wandered off the beaten path. In the younger forest
one can encounter, bears, wolves, deer, small birds, and numerous
varieties of rodents and insects.

# Description

The Southern Plane of Serenity rests between the southern edge of the Forest of
Brume and the Northern edge of the Burning Expanse. On its western edge is the
great sea and to the East is the Uraval Mountain's southern tip and the great
stone tree that is home to the city of Avian.  The Southern Plane of Serenity is
much like the grasslands to the north except that it is less well patrolled and
thusly several predators call the area home, including several varieties of
large cats, some small bears and numerous clans of goblins. Much less developed
than the Northern Planes, this area is covered with rich, arable land that goes
largely unused, although not completely as a few homesteads have been set up to
take advantage of the land. The roads here are well maintained and well
traveled, although not by patrolling guards so there is the occasional attack on
travelers although it is not common.

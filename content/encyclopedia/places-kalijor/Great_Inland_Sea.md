## Description

The Great Inland Sea is the largest, land-locked body of water in
Kalijor. It is surrounded by the Forest of Brume and on the southern and
western shores lay the oldest parts of the forest. This huge body of
water is dark and calm, relatively warm and, if you stay close to shore,
safe for swimming in. As you move toward the center of the sea, or the
southwest edge, the creatures living in the waters become much large,
more powerful, and more aggressive. No one knows why this is but most
scholars and druids link it to the proximity of the old forest.

## Features/Places of Note

Somewhere in the southwestern sea is rumored to be a small island with
an ancient stone temple on it. This temple is guarded by strange
creatures that attack without warning and destroy all traces of
intruders.

# Description

The Great Inland Sea is the largest, land-locked body of water in Kalijor. It is
surrounded by the Forest of Brume and on the southern and western shores lay the
oldest parts of the forest. This huge body of water is dark and calm, relatively
warm and, if you stay close to shore, safe for swimming in. As you move toward
the center of the sea, or the southwest edge, the creatures living in the waters
become much large, more powerful, and more aggressive. No one knows why this is
but most scholars and druids link it to the proximity of the old forest.

# Features/Places of Note

Somewhere in the southwestern sea is rumored to be a small island with an
ancient stone temple on it. This temple is guarded by strange creatures that
attack without warning and destroy all traces of intruders.

## Description

The Dead Sea is a large, rancid body of sickly, thick, green water that
rests in the southern end of the Plain of Sorrow. This sea was once a
life spring before it was corrupted by some unknown force that destroyed
it and the ancient forest surrounding it.

Nothing living resides in the Dead Sea, although several demons and
undead creatures make their homes beneath its toxic waters, venturing
out only to seek fresh souls to feed their ravenous appetites.

## Features/Places of Note

The beaches surrounding the sea are composed of the same, thick, ruddy,
fine dirt as the rest of the Plain of Sorrow, although here it is much
moister, sticks in larger clumps and in some places acts as a heavy
quicksand, actually pulling people as much as three feet down and making
it nearly impossible for most to extricate themselves without
assistance.

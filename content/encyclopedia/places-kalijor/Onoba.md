## Description

Onoba is the name given to the home of the Obscuri. While the Obscuri
themselves are beyond such things as names, no attempt has been made to
discourage the use of this name and so it has become the common name of
their place of residence. Onoba is a city that has been molded into the
interior of the peaks of the Uraval Mountains . The caves are composed
of obsidian, basalt, black marble and granite, and cobalt among other
dense, darkly colored materials. To a normal person the walls, floors,
ceilings, doors, in fact every surface in the city appears to be black,
making navigation extremely difficult if not impossible, and discerning
fine details is equally as difficult as it is challenging to see where
one surface stops and another begins. To the Obscuri however, the city
is a cacophony of colors and textures. With their senses having been
altered by their association with primal forces, and centuries spent
living in the dark caves, they had become able to see the myriad of
differences within these materials.

In terms of population and land area, Onoba is similar to Pandoria,
playing host to around five-hundred thousand residents and encompassing
more than fifty square miles of area overall.

## Description

The Gelid Mountains are a range of low mountains that sit between the
Southern Wastes and the Northern Wastes. The largest peak in the range
is Mount Tellamon, the home of the city of Talanor. The mountains,
although low in elevation are frigid cold year round. They are nearly
always shrouded in heavy, dark clouds and suffering from constant
blizzard conditions.

While not impassable, the mountains are certainly not the sort of place
one would want to visit just for fun, unless your idea of fun happens to
include clinging to sheer, ice-covered cliff faces in white-out blizzard
conditions.

There is no source of food or water worth speaking of in these frigid
mountains. Some travelers claim to have encountered a few manticor and
other, similarly powerful and solitary creatures there.

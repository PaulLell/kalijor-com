# Description

The Gelid Mountains are a range of low mountains that sit between the Southern
Wastes and the Northern Wastes. The largest peak in the range is Mount Tellamon,
the home of the city of Talanor. The mountains, although low in elevation are
frigid cold year round. They are nearly always shrouded in heavy, dark clouds
and suffering from constant blizzard conditions.

While not impassable, the mountains are certainly not the sort of place one
would want to visit just for fun, unless your idea of fun happens to include
clinging to sheer, ice-covered cliff faces in white-out blizzard conditions.

There is no source of food or water worth speaking of in these frigid mountains.
Some travelers claim to have encountered a few manticor and other, similarly
powerful and solitary creatures there.

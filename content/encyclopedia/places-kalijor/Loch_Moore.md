## Description

Loch Moore is a small frontier town on the edge of the Burning Expanse.
Its people are mostly simple farmers and live stock handlers, with a few
artisans having taken up residence as the town becomes more and more
popular among wayward adventurers on their way into the Burning Expanse
in search of fortune and glory. The government of Loch Moore is simple,
made up of a council of residents that meet on a monthly basis to decide
any matters of importance. There are indications that this small town
may experience a growth spurt in the near future as it becomes more and
more the gateway to the sweltering lands to the south.

Loch Moore is an up-and-coming frontier town that sits on the rather
harsh dividing line between the Southern Plain of Serenity and the
Burning Expanse. The town is constructed mostly of wood and thatch and
is small and mostly pleasant.

Residents number into the thousands now although the population can
fluctuate to as high as ten to fifteen thousand people depending upon
what is happening south of the city in the expanse.

## Features/Places of Note

Loch Moore is home to several reasonable craftsmen that are capable of
performing most basic weapon and armor repairs, provide good, hearty
meals and rations and several of life's niceties, such as warm baths and
clean beds.

While it is by no means a city on par with Rathalon or Talanor it is
still a good place to find the basics that you might need on the spot
before heading out to seek your fortune.

Loch Moore is not on the Kalijor portal network, and is at least a few
days travel from the nearest city which is Avian, and that is if you
have a fast mount. On foot it could take nearly two weeks to make the
journey, although occasionally one can find a griffon for hire in Avian
that will haul you to Loch Moore for a hefty fee.

Loch Moore plays host to several inns, numerous taverns, more than one
brothel, several smiths and leather workers, provisioners, and it is
rumored that one of the largest gathering places for the assassin's
guild is somewhere within the limits of this small city.

## Description

The Burning Expanse is a vast, flat, wasteland of scorching sand and
heat. There is no water in the Burning Expanse save for a small oasis
that is surrounded by high, impassable cliffs in the southeastern corner
of the area. There are no roads here, no cities, no homes, and
definitely no guards or patrols. The area is littered with giant
scorpions, giants, snakes and other predators that have adapted well to
the harsh conditions. The Burning Expanse is rumored to be the resting
place of another of the five ziggurats of Kalijor where the ancient
Obscuri artifacts are hidden away from the world. In the center of the
Burning Expanse is a large fissure that drops away seemingly into
nothingness below and it is within this fissure that there is a
long-buried dungeon that adventurers frequent in search of treasures of
all kinds. The dungeon is the ancient home of a powerful
mage-turned-lich and is crawling with powerful undead of all kinds.

The Burning Expanse is a huge area of desert that lay south of the
Southern Plain of Serenity and stretches to the south edge of Kalijor.
On the western edge it butts up against the Endless Ocean and stretched
far to the east until it runs into the southern tail of the Uraval
Mountains.

## Features/Places of Note

The burning Expanse has only two remarkable features. The first is an
oasis, surrounded by high cliff walls in the bottom central area of the
region, the other is a deep fissure in the sands a bit northwest of the
oasis. The fissure is the entry point to several deep caverns beneath
the surface where adventurers seem to favor looking for treasure.

This region is populated by tribes of creatures that have insect-like
lower bodies and somewhat human upper bodies. They are a war-like race
that tends to prey upon travelers, then use the equipment they scavenge
from them to wage war against their own rival tribes.

There are also numerous desert species living here, mostly snakes,
insects and smaller animals, a few birds of prey and the occasional
larger predatory animals.

The average temperature in the Burning Expanse is in excess of 40
degrees Celsius with almost no measurable precipitation.

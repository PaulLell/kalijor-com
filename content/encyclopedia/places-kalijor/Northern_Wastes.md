## Description

The Northern wastes is a region of snowy land nestled in a hollow
depression on the west side of Mount Telemon. The hollow is surrounded
on all sides by impassible mountains, making the only easy access to the
Northern Wastes through the city of Talanor. The region is frigid cold,
and under constant cover of blizzard. The terrain is rocky and difficult
to navigate, especially with the low visibility conditions created by
the constant snow. The region plays host to all manner of animals and
creatures including elk, large hunting cats, and great white bears. The
deeper one travels into the region the more aggressive the creatures
become. In the center of the Northern Wastes is a large mound topped
with one of the five ziggurats of Kalijor that are reputed to be the
resting place of ancient Obscuri artifacts created before the wars. On
the mound, surrounding the ziggurat a clan of giants has taken up
residence, their thick skins protecting them from the cold and their
unpleasant attitudes keeping the place clear travelers.

The Northern Wastes is a frigid, inhospitable region that lay in a large
depression in the Gelid Mountains, northwest of Mount Tellamon. This
region is constantly under the cloud of winter and its temperatures
rarely rise above about ten degrees below zero Celsius.

There are near-constant blizzard conditions here and a traveler can
rarely see more than twenty feet ahead of themselves.

## Features/Places of Note

Animals here include a few elk, wolves, and some large hunting cats and
bears in addition to some small rodents.

As one moves deeper into the area there is a strange rock formation that
is extremely large and stepped as it rises out of the ground like a
massive pyramid. It would be extremely difficult to ascend under the
best of circumstances but here it is an exercise in insanity. Partially
due to the weather, but the futility of the act is reinforced by the
giants that prowl the strange structure. Rumors have it that there may
be an ancient temple of some sort at the top of the formation, although
no one has been able to confirm this as no one is known to have ever
returned from an ascent up the formation.

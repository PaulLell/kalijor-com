## Description

Talanor is the home of Kalijor's Dwarves and Gnomes. It is a city that
is carved out of the belly of Mount Telemon to the north of Rathalon,
between the snowy Northern and Southern Wastes. The city maintains a
constant level of lighting and temperature day and night, year round
which makes it uncomfortable for most surface-dwelling people to handle
on a continuous basis. Talanor is home to some of Kalijor's most highly
celebrated craftsmen across several disciplines, blacksmithing, jewelry
crafting, tattooing, piercing, and invention/innovation. The city houses
hundreds of thousands of long-term citizens as well as thousands of
transients on any given day and is the gateway into the old mines where
the ancient Dwarven city of Kal’ek T’nal, long abandoned since the great
war.

Talanor is the subterranean city located within Mt. Tellamon far to the
north of Rathalon, across the frosty Southern Wastes.

Talanor is a large city, playing home to nearly a million sentients,
mostly dwarves and gnomes. It is the home of most of Kalijor's best
craftsmen, especially in the fields of metallurgy and geology.

## Features/Places of Note

The construction techniques of Talanor vary but most structures are made
from stone and other forms of masonry, most of which has been excavated
from the local mines that open into the city along its periphery. The
city is housed mostly within one central chamber that is massive in
scale, with its ceiling high enough that it is out of sight of most
races, disappearing into the darkness and haze that blankets the top of
the cavern.

Major features of the city include the forge, the arena, and the dojo.

The forge is a massive building housing hundreds of forges and
foundries. This is the place to go if you are looking for any
blacksmithed equipment, most of which is of exceptional quality as the
forge is operated by some of the best dwarven and gnomish smiths in
Kalijor.

The arena is one of the largest public arenas in Kalijor. Its bouts are
famous for being fairly officiated and well documented.

The dojo is a large structure with one large, central room and numerous
outlying rooms, each of which is set up as a training facility for
martial artists. The dojo is renowned throughout Kalijor as the premier
training location for martial artists and is home to some of the most
highly regarded masters alive today.

There is a small portal chamber in Talanor connecting it to Rathalon
through the Kalijor portal network.

## Government

Government in Talanor is almost nonexistent. The city is governed by a
confederation of craftsmen that make policy decisions through debate
over drinks in local taverns.

There is a local militia that is peopled by the instructors from the
dojo who take rotating shifts as guards at the main gates and other
populace locations such as the market and the arena.

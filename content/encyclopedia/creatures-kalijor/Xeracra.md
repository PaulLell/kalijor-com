Xeracra are large cat-like creatures with thinly placed, thick-bristled
hair that is a sickly grey color. They have six powerful, stocky limbs
that make them both swift and silent. Their mouth is like a great
shark’s with multiple rows of short, serrated teeth that all point
back toward the animal’s throat. They have four eyes, two vivid green
orbs set into the front of their head, and two glossy black ones that
are much smaller and positioned one on either side of the animal’s head,
just in front of its huge ears that each sport a tuft of hairs sprouting
from its extreme tip. The predators have long, whip-like tails that
stick straight out behind them like a rudder. Xeracra are solitary
hunters that stalk their prey, usually over long distances before
pouncing from behind or from the shadows. Their normal tactic is to grip
prey with its fore legs and tear it to pieces with its four rear legs to
kill it as quickly as possible. Smaller prey is usually caught in its
massive jaws and killed by grinding teeth and working it towards its
throat.

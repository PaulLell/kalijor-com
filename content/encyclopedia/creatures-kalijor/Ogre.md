Ogres are tall, thickly built creatures that carry enormous physical strength as their primary attribute. They have little or no hair on their bodies, both male and female, and any hair they do have tends to be wispy and light in color, to the point of being nearly undetectable under casual scrutiny. They appear as huge, lumbering brutes and indeed are among the strongest sentient races of Kalijor. Most ogres are of average intelligence but some have proven themselves to be extremely intelligent, to the point of becoming extremely adept mages. While certainly not the rule, such ogres are not so rare as to be unheard of.

Most ogres choose professions in physical areas, construction, labor, and farm work. They also make extremely adept warriors and infantry for any group of adventurers or armies that need stout fighters on their side.

Average Life Span: 200 to 300 years.

Average Height: 6 to 12 feet.

Average Weight: 250 to 800 pounds.

Eyes: Browns, greens, blues, yellows, reds and oranges.

Hair: Sparse and nearly transparent.

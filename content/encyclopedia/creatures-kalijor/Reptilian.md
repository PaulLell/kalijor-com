Reptilians are a race of highly evolved reptiles, just as their name
would suggest. Reptilians are usually thin, but strong, and light in
weight. They usually have no body hair what so ever, although the
occasional reptilian has been seen with a mane of thick, straight hairs
on their neck. What causes this is unknown and it is extremely rare.
Their skin is covered in scales that range from medium to coarse in
texture and a variety of patterns and ridges can be seen from family
line to family line. They have long, pointed teeth that are designed to
rip and tear flesh, which is their sole source of nutrition, providing
both food and liquid for their bodies. They do imbibe the occasional
drink when in the company of other races but this is more a social
nicity than anything else as they derive no value what so ever from
doing so and are in fact entirely unaffected by alcohol and any other
poisons or toxins that are ingested orally.

Scale colorations range all over but usually have either a green,
yellow, or black base to them. They are physically strong (MUCH stronger
than they look in most cases) and extremely intelligent. Reptilians make
superb mages, martial artists, scholars, politicians, and merchants.

Average Height: 3 to 8 feet.

Average Weight: 90 to 500 pounds.

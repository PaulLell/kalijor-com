Felinoids appear to be a combination of cats and humans. They are covered in fur, which is typically short and soft although some have had coarse or long fur, from head to toe. They have pointed, articulated ears, whiskers, slitted pupils, a keen sense of smell and retractable claws in their fingers and toes. Most felinoids have tails and their coloring and patterning ranges all over the place, some following similar designs as typical big game cats, others more like the more domesticated house cats. Felinoides are a tribal people that make excellent hunters and scouts. While most have avoided larger population centers, a few have embraced modern civilization and opened businesses as hunters, tanners, guides, scouts, and even more mundane occupations.

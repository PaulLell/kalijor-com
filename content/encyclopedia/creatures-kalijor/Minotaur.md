+++

Minotaur are a bovine species that look like a hybrid of a human and a bull (This is not the case however, and will incur their wrath if it is suggested in their presence). They are covered in coarse hair, have hooves for feet, human-like hands and the head of a large bull. Minotaur are extremely strong and make excellent fighters/warriors. Their race is honorable and proud, but not to a fault. They are sensible and make shrewd negotiators, although sometimes their tempers can flare and have been known to turn violent easily under the correct circumstances.

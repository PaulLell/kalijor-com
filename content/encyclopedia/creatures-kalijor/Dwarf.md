title: Dwarf

Dwarves are a subterranean race that are intelligent, belligerent, and extremely
capable builders and excavators. As a rule, dwarves make excellent craftsmen and
artisans, some of the finest weapons and armor in Kalijor have been credited
back to dwarven craftsmen. Dwarves and elves tend not to get along very well due
to some ancient hostility between their two peoples, although not openly
combative under normal circumstances, it takes very little coaxing to get a
dwarf to into a confrontation with an elf. Dwarves are intelligent, shrewd
negotiators, superb cooks and brewers, and fair wielders of magic, especially
where such magics will in any way enhance their artisan skills.

title: Troll
---

Trolls are tall, skinny, physically powerful, and normally assumed to be
not terribly bright, although this often proves to be a fatal mistake to
make. They range in color from yellow, through green, brown, and reddish
colors. Trolls normally have large tufts of hair sticking out all over
their bodies in strange directions with no apparent rhyme or reason to
their placement. Their facial features are gaunt, angular, and almost
all severely pointed. They have large, pointy teeth that are
asymmetrically placed in their misshaped jaws and long, pointy ears that
stick off the sides of their heads at strange angles.

All this having been said, trolls are remarkably intelligent creatures
that tend to have a very good understanding of the world and most things
in it. While extremely strong physically (approaching the strength of
ogres), most trolls choose to live solitary, secluded lives, staying out
of the affairs of other mortal creatures. A troll's inherent
understanding of the world and how it works tends to make them unpopular
in most social gatherings as most sentient beings tend to shy away from
people that can offer real, valuable solutions to their issues,
preferring instead to blunder about their lives looking at things
through their own shaded glasses.

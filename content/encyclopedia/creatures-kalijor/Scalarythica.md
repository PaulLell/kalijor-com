These animals resemble a short, fat alligator with twelve short, fat
tentacles instead of normal legs. They have a jaw full of short, pointy
teeth and are voracious predators. They hunt and travel in packs, using
coordinated efforts and tactics, often driving prey into ambushes and
using terrain features to their advantage. They are incredibly fast
considering their bulk, especially in tight spaces and obstructed
environments such as forests and jungles where their many flexible
appendages offer them excellent footing and balance. They are excellent
climbers, fare reasonably well in the water and can leap as much as
twenty feet from a standing position. These creatures are rarely seen by
people as they tend to live in deep jungle and ancient forest where most
adventurers rarely reach.

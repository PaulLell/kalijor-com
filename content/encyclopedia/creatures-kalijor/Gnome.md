title: Gnome

Gnomes are small, generally frail looking individuals that normally live in subterranean locations. They are smaller even than dwarves but seem to share their same brash attitudes, tending to think everyone else is intellectually inferior to them despite any illustrations to the contrary. Gnomes are consummate tinkerers, always trying to invent or improve things in strange new ways. The studious nature of gnomes makes them excellent mages while their small stature makes them a poor choice for physical combat, although such things are not entirely unheard of. The complexion of a gnome can range all over the place from pale, sickly white to dark brown, almost ebony depending upon their lineage and point of origin.

title: Cold Fusion
---

One of the five corporations that make up [The Conglomerate](../the_conglomerate).
Cold Fusion began life as a nuclear fusion research organization that, through
the years, evolved into various forms of production and other research. Their
insights into fusion power cells allowed them to quickly dominate the mobile
technology market and most mobile devices still use their power cells (or power
cells based upon their original designs) to this day. The Cold Fusion
corporation practices business honorably, but they treat other corporate
entities as they are treated by them. Those corporations that interact with them
honorably are treated the same in return, those corporations that operate
outside the realm of honor are treated with nothing but contempt and their
secrets are forcibly uncovered, stolen, and put to use as Cold Fusion
technologies. The CEO of Cold Fusion is a man by the name of Ren Hakiro.

title: Solidarity Online
---

The company responsible for the creation, maintenance and operation of the
Kalijor fantasy MMO. Despite Kalijor's significance in the corporate setting,
Solidarity Online is ~not~ a member of [The Conglomerate](../the_conglomerate).
Although it remains uncertain if this fact is due to the Conglomerate's
decision, or if it is Solidarity Onine's desire to remain unaffiliated.
Solidarity Online operates dozens of different MMO's all of which are very
successful and cover a myriad of genre, but Kalijor is by far their most well
known and successful game world.

There is very little in the way of internal politics within the organization,
having been run by [Xavier Quinn](../../people-future/xavier_quinn) for as long
as anyone can remember. He is a very stern, if fair and level headed leader who
has always kept the company profitable and growing.

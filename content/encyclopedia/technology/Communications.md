The standard communication medium of the day has become sub-space.
Sub-space is mathematically defined as an infinite space that exists
within our realm inside a finite boundary. It was discovered in the past
300 years that in any given sub-space realm there is a direct
correlation between each point in that realm and each point within our
own. However, energy behaves differently within any given sub-space
realm than it does within normal-space. As an example, radio waves
travel at extremely high relativistic speeds within certain sub-space
realms, allowing the injection of a radio wave at one point in
normal-space where it will cross sub-space at extreme super-luminal
speeds (on the order of 10^21c) where the receiving unit will then pull
the signal back out of sub-space again. This method allows for nearly
instantaneous, extremely low latency communications across nearly
limitless spans of real-space.

Sub-space communications technology is still relatively large
physically, with transceivers requiring around six cubic feet of space
and large power supplies.

Most normal, short distance communications (short distance being under
1,000 miles or so) are still done using digitally encoded, secure radio
frequency communications. Normal-space communicators use a variety of
frequencies from 25MHz all the way up to 10GHz and an even broader array
of digital compression/encryption. Most high quality communicators are
capable of using any and all combinations of frequency and
compression/encryption but some of the less expensive gear is limited in
this regard, however it is not usually a concern as all you need is two
similar devices to set up a line of communication. In terms of physical
size, standard RF transceivers can be as small as a peanut (including
the power supply, the actual transceiver is extremely small at about
1/10 that size).

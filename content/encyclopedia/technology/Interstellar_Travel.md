Super-Luminal propulsion is a relatively new science as far as practical
application is concerned. There are currently two very different
technologies in use by space craft. Gravitic drives, and Traction
drives.

Gravitic drives harness the power of gravity to propel a space craft
faster than the speed of light. By focusing a beam of focused gravitons,
the craft is able to push itself away from solid matter with great
force. Initially gravitic drives only worked while in relative close
proximity to large celestial bodies such as stars and planets, but as
the technology was refined it became less dependant on such ‘anchor
points’ and is now capable of propelling itself through open space by
repelling its graviton beam off of free roaming particles in space.
Gravitic drives offer high acceleration characteristics but overall low
speeds when compared to traction drives, capable of traveling from
twenty to fifty times the speed of light allowing voyages to Sol’s
closest neighbors (Around 6 light years distant) to be made in the
extremely short time frame of two to five months instead of the
previously unheard of time frame of ten years.

Tracton Drives use a relatively new discovery to provide propulsion.
Recently (In the last hundred years or so) it was discovered that there
are several ‘layers’ of space, both above and below (relatively) our own
‘real space’. These layers of sub-space offered numerous new scientific
possibilities as it was discovered that particles behave differently in
different layers of space and sub-space. One of these new technologies
was sub-space communications, which allows instantaneous communication
between extremely distant points in space over dozens of light years.
One of the newer developments is a starship drive system that creates an
energy field around the ship that allows it to grab on to or ‘grip’ a
near-by layer of sub-space and crawl along through real space using that
connection to sub-space as traction. Traction drives provide a smooth,
constant acceleration and an extremely high (Still unknown at this
point) maximum velocity. There is theoretically no maximum velocity for
a traction drive; they can keep accelerating indefinitely using a
constant amount of energy. With their slow acceleration and deceleration
Traction drives are sometimes looked down upon but their unknown maximum
velocity tends to help some people overlook the drawbacks. Traction
drives can make the same voyages as Gravitic drives in five to sixty
percent less time depending upon the distance, the further the trip the
faster the drive can go.

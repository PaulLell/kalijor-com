Energy shields come in a couple of different forms. The earliest forms
of energy shielding for space craft were nothing more than sophisticated
tracking algorithms designed to track incoming debris and then vaporize
it with a ship's weapon systems. This system proved to be effective,
however costly in terms of computer power, sensor usage, and energy
consumption. These systems were adept at eliminating space debris and
small particles but proved ineffectual at handling most incoming weapons
fire and extremely small matter such as micro-meteorites that could
still cause significant damage to a space vessel.

Later systems took advantage of advances in electromagnetic field
manipulation to actually create a high energy barrier between the vessel
and oncoming particles which would then simply impact the field and be
destroyed by it. This system required nowhere nears as much computer or
sensor power, although power consumption actually increased several
fold. The benefits outweighed the energy cost in most instances however
as these fields would handle weapons fire and all space debris including
the microscopic particles that most consumer ship-board sensors were not
even capable of tracking. These shields could be manually, or computer
controlled to cover specific areas of the ship, i.e.: fore, aft, port,
starboard, dorsal, or ventral, but not the entire vessel at once.
Multiple fields could be created if multiple field generators, and power
plants were installed to support such a set up.

Present systems are now tapping the gravitic super-luminal drive systems
to create walls, or bubbles of graviton particles that effectively act
as a solid wall or physical barrier to incoming matter/weapons fire.
These systems are much more energy efficient since they are simply
harnessing an existing particle rather than energizing and causing phase
shifts on stored particles. These fields envelop the entire vessel and
can remain engaged indefinitely in most cases, although multiple,
severe, and/or sustained impacts with a graviton shield will draw
increasing amounts of power from the ship's generators and cause them to
heat up at an accelerated pace, necessitating cool down periods and
large/heavy heat syncs/cooling units to be installed along with the
field generators.

The current generation of gravitic shielding is by far the most common
and economical in use today and its refinement is leading to development
of more tightly controlled, energy efficient, and smaller artificial
gravity systems.

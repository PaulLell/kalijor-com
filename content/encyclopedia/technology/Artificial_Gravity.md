Artificial gravity is created, in most cases, by placing a disk made of
super-conducting material inside a sealed environment. The disk is
suspended within a magnetic field so that it can not touch any portion
of its casing, and then spun at extreme velocities (Approximately
130,000 RPM). This creates a gravito-magnetic field that extends outward
from the device in a 100 ft radius. For most small craft, one or two
generators is usually enough to create approximately 1G (Earth normal)
of gravitational force throughout the entire vessel.

It is important to note that the addition of artificial gravity to
space-faring vessels, while an important step towards space exploration
and colonization, was not the final answer needed to make it more
plausible. There are several factors of space travel that must be
considered for long-term exposure purposes, gravity being a significant
one. Other factors include but are not limited to the following:

Radiation/EM shielding (filtering out those energies present in space
which are NOT present in a livable atmosphere)

Radiation and EM field generation (reproducing those energies that ARE
present in a livable atmosphere, and necessary for long-term health)

Acceleration/decelaeraion/inertial compensation (in order to keep the
human body from turning to paste during sudden maneuvers and alterations
in ship velocities)

These gravity generating devices can also be used in fixed/planetary
applications in order to increase whatever gravity they have to 1G. In
this application they are usually known as "Gravity Levelers" since they
are not creating the entire gravity field by themselves, but rather
adding to an existing field in order to increase its strength. At
present there is no known way of reducing a gravity field in order to
make high gravity installations more palatable to the human body.

There is research into other means of creating gravity artificially,
using the same principals as the Gravitic super-luminal drive systems,
however, creating a field that is dispersed widely enough and
consistently enough for practical purposes is proving to be troublesome
at present.

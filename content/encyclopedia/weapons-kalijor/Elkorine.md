title: Elkorine
---

Elkorine is a short sword that was forged by the elves that would later become
known as the enigmatic Obscuri, long before the great wars. The sword has been
carried by many individuals throughout its life, almost all of whom have become
notable in some regard or other. The weapon has a tendency to turn up in the
hands of the less likely people in history and is said to have a mind of its
own, although no one can recall or find evidence of it. It is about two and a
half feet long including the small, one handed handle. The blade is a dark grey
metal, polished to a mirror finish that never seems to tarnish or fade. The hilt
is made of a glossy black material that sweeps across the blade in an elegant
arc with the tips pointed toward the tip of the blade. The handle is made of a
material similar to the blade, although it is somehow soft to the touch and
conforming to the shape of the wielderâ€™s hand. The pommel is also a mirror
polished glossy black material. The name Elkorine is written in elvish in a
sweeping arc down the handle from hilt to pommel on one side, and the fullers of
the blade are inscribed with ancient elvish power runes in a dialect known only
to the Obscuri. The weapon is impossibly light, almost weightless, and perfectly
balanced. It is, by all accounts, indestructible, and always razor sharp.

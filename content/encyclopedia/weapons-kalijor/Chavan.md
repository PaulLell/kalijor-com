Chavan is the staff given to Katrina Thorindal by Dorin. It is forged of
a rare earth metal alloy that makes it lighter than most wooden staves
and stronger than most tempered metals. In addition, Dorin imbued the
staff with several magical abilities as he forged it. It is a light grey
in color and covered from tip to tip in dwarvish runes that make no
coherent sense. Itâ€™s unique powers include the ability for the staff to
create a small pool of cool, pure drinking water by leaving it laying
prone on the ground for a moment, the ability to attract small game
animals by stabbing the staff into the ground and letting it stand for a
few moments, and the ability to cast a steady, white light, of similar
intensity to a high quality torch by tapping one of its ends against the
ground several times repeatedly.

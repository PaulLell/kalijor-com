title: Chavan
---

Chavan is the staff given to Katrina Thorindal by Dorin. It is forged of a rare
earth metal alloy that makes it lighter than most wooden staves and stronger
than most tempered metals. In addition, Dorin imbued the staff with several
magical abilities as he forged it. It is a light grey in color and covered from
tip to tip in dwarvish runes that make no coherent sense. It’s unique powers
include the ability for the staff to create a small pool of cool, pure drinking
water by leaving it laying prone on the ground for a moment, the ability to
attract small game animals by stabbing the staff into the ground and letting it
stand for a few moments, and the ability to cast a steady, white light, of
similar intensity to a high quality torch by tapping one of its ends against the
ground several times repeatedly.

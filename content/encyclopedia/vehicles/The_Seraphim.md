## General Description

The Seraphim is a tiny, 2 passenger shuttle owned and Operated by [Niko
Nori](Niko_Nori "wikilink"). It hangers at her private facility in
[Ceres](Ceres "wikilink") and is maintained only by her. If Niko were
ever forced to reveal that she actually had any special feelings for an
object, it would be this ship, as it was the vessel that she used to
bring [Alina](Alina_Martin "wikilink") home to her after she escaped the
clutches of [Tor Rayean](Tor_Rayean "wikilink") in
[Tranquility](Tranquility "wikilink").

The Seraphim is an ultra-fast performance vessel that has been kitted
out with a few ammenities, such as a small sleeping cabin and a
functioning bathing tub. To compensate for these additions, and to
increase her performance envelope, all other non-essentials have been
trimmed out, including any and all weapon systems, armor, and combat
shielding. She maintains strong navigational shields, an extremely
advanced sensory suite, and top of the line avionics and RCS/maneuvering
systems, making her an extremely nimble craft in nearly any environment.
Added to that, is the fact that she is powered by two high-output plasma
drives that are well above her weight class, and a set of JATO/RATO
boosters (Jet/Rocket Assisted Take-Off) for escaping high-gravity wells,
or for an extra burst of speed in a pinch.

The Seraphim, while certainly not the fastest ship around, is easily in
the top 50, and can make the run from Earth to Luna, a trip that takes
most vessels 5-6 hours, and sprinters such as The Kestrel, 3-4 hours, in
just over an hour.

While Niko tends to stay in and around Ceres with her obligations
demanding much of her time, Alina uses The Seraphim to make her trips to
and from runner facilities to secure business, maintain relationships
with customers, and carve out new market share for their operations.

## History

## Spoilers

<spoiler text="Status">Status: In Service</spoiler>
<spoiler text="Riana and the Seraphim"> Riana borrowed the Seraphim in
the fourth novel after waking up from a six month, artificialy induced
coma to find that Anja had gone on a bloody rampage across the Sol
System, using her name. While sprinting to Neo-Tokyo to put a stop to
Anja's activities, she was attacked by several pirate vessels and forced
to use The Seraphim's speed and agility to out-maneuver and confound the
pirates before escaping to safety. </spoiler>

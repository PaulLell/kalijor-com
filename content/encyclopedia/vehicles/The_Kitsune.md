# General Description

The Kitsune is a brand new, top of the line, personal spacecraft equipped with
all the luxuries. There is a private cabin with a queen-sized bed, and a private
bathroom, with a shower, a general-use head, and a large multi-purpose room that
functions as a kitchen, dining room, and media-viewing area. Passengers can also
make use of the smaller quarters that is equipped with two double bunks that are
larger than normal bunks, but still small.

The cargo area rests amid-ships, between the engine room and the passenger
compartments. It holds a small amount of cargo, with approximately 150 square
feet of floor space, and can be depressurized separately from the rest of the
ship, although there is no dedicated airlock between the cargo hold and other
cabins.

With her throttle open fully, she is nearly as fast as [The
Kestrel](../the_kestrel) at sub-luminal velocities, able to make runs from Earth
to Luna in 4-5 hours (as opposed to the Kestrel's 3-4 hours).

The heart and soul of the Kitsune however, is a custom made, bio-neural computer
system that is home to an expiramental Artifical Intelligence that has complete
control of the ship and all its systems, as well as having access to the
internet via sub-space transceiver.  [SEAN](../../people-future/sean), the
ship's AI, is programmed to serve and protect [Lana
Frederick](../../people-future/lana_frederick), and her father, [Doctor Emil
Frederick](../../people-future/emil_frederick_phd/), who designed the bio-neural
computer system that is SEAN's home.

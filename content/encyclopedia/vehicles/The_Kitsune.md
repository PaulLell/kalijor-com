## General Description

The Kitsune is a brand new, top of the line, personal spacecraft
equipped with all the luxuries. There is a private cabin with a
queen-sized bed, and a private bathroom, with a shower, a general-use
head, and a large multi-purpose room that functions as a kitchen, dining
room, and media-viewing area. Passengers can also make use of the
smaller quarters that is equipped with two double bunks that are larger
than normal bunks, but still small.

The cargo area rests amid-ships, between the engine room and the
passenger compartments. It holds a small amount of cargo, with
approximately 150 square feet of floor space, and can be depressurized
separately from the rest of the ship, although there is no dedicated
airlock between the cargo hold and other cabins.

With her throttle open fully, she is nearly as fast as [The
Kestrel](The_Kestrel "wikilink") at sub-luminal velocities, able to make
runs from Earth to Luna in 4-5 hours (as opposed to the Kestrel's 3-4
hours).

The heart and soul of the Kitsune however, is a custom made, bio-neural
computer system that is home to an expiramental Artifical Intelligence
that has complete control of the ship and all its systems, as well as
having access to the internet via sub-space transceiver.
[SEAN](SEAN "wikilink"), the ship's AI, is programmed to serve and
protect [Lana Frederick](Lana_Frederick "wikilink"), and her father,
[Doctor Emil Frederick](Emil_Frederick,_PHD "wikilink"), who designed
the bio-neural computer system that is SEAN's home.

## General Description

The Riotous Good Time is an older vessel, captained by Kaden McGinley, a
mutual friend of [Alina Martin](Alina_Martin "wikilink") and
[Niko](Niko_Nori "wikilink"). The ship is older, but not ancient, and is
in an excellent state of repair for its age. Originally a passenger
ship, the Good Time has been refitted numerous times over its life, and
is now a combination passenger, and cargo/smuggling ship. As a result of
this, the ship has much more comfortable passenger quarters than most
cargo vessels, and is better suited to long hauls of small, important
cargo or VIPs than the mass-hauling that most Runners engage in.

The Riotous Good Time has medium shielding, heavy armor, and only
defensive weapons and countermeasures, but its sensor suite is among the
best available, even by military standards.

# General Description

The Riotous Good Time is an older vessel, captained by Kaden McGinley, a mutual
friend of [Alina Martin](../../people-future/alina_martin) and
[Niko](../../people-future/niko_nori). The ship is older, but not ancient, and is
in an excellent state of repair for its age. Originally a passenger ship, the
Good Time has been refitted numerous times over its life, and is now a
combination passenger, and cargo/smuggling ship. As a result of this, the ship
has much more comfortable passenger quarters than most cargo vessels, and is
better suited to long hauls of small, important cargo or VIPs than the
mass-hauling that most Runners engage in.

The Riotous Good Time has medium shielding, heavy armor, and only defensive
weapons and countermeasures, but its sensor suite is among the best available,
even by military standards.

## General Description

The Kestrel is a small, sleek, silver shuttle that [Solidarity
Online](Solidarity_Online "wikilink") commissioned for, and assigned to,
[Willhelmina](Willhelmina_Orlova "wikilink") and
[Riana](Riana_Shandra_Thorindal "wikilink") for use in their duties as
couriers for the company. The ship is capable of comfortably
accommodating three people, but could handle as many as six if the need
arose and comfort was not a concern.

It looks like a bird of prey, with a hooked nose just below the forward
viewport and dramatically forward-swept wings that curve down from the
top of the shipâ€™s mid section. The ailerons spread out from the top of
the tail section in a fan shape, helping to complete the bird of prey
image that netted the vessel its name. The ship is by no means a combat
vessel, although it is more than capable of putting up a fight, its true
calling is its ability to out-maneuver and out-run most other vessels
and simply escape from the scene of any potential battles.

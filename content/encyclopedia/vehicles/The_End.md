## General Description

This ancient (pre war) ship is one of the first intrastellar craft built
for personal use. It is an extremely simple, circular design with very
strong armor, weak shields, and moderate defensive weapons. The interior
design consists of a single, circular hallway that runs through the
ship, with quarters, living areas, the bridge, and the engine room all
located on the outside of the ring, against the outer hull, and the
mid-sized cargo hold nestled in the center, toward the bottom of the
vessel. Cargo is loaded and off-loaded via a circular pad that descends
from the bottom of the ship, and makes up the entire floor of the cargo
hold, which allows extremely easy access to the entire space for
purposes of loading, unloading, and sorting cargo.

The ship is not only extremely old, but it is showing its age. Tor does
little to keep the vessel in good condition, only spending money on it
when something is broken. He does not clean any of the interior spaces,
making the entire habitable area look like a garbage dump, and smell
like one too. The only exception to this is the cockpit, which he
routinely upgrades with the best controls and acoutriments available. It
is little wonder then, that he spends most of his time in his extremely
comfortable, extremely expensive, captain's chair.

## Special Features of Note

The ship's old design means there are lots of little (and some large)
nooks and crannies that can be used to stash away any less-than-legal
cargo he might be hauling.

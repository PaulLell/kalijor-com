<a href="https://www.kalijor.com/wp-content/uploads/edd/2013/07/RPG-eCover1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-1123" style="margin-top: 5px; margin-bottom: 5px;" alt="RPG eCover" src="https://www.kalijor.com/wp-content/uploads/edd/2013/07/RPG-eCover1-229x300.jpg" width="229" height="300" /></a>I will be playing a bit with this page until I get it settled in, but the intention is to post regular story ideas for the Kalijor RPG. I hope to give players quick access to story ideas, NPCs, and other information that will inspire, or completely facilitate campaigns and adventure ideas.

Presentation of these ideas will be in a consistent style with a quick line or two to setup the situation, a description of the meat of the plot that will get characters engaged, and then a plot twist or turn that serves as the 'big reveal' for the adventure. Any relevant NPCs or other world or equipment data will be provided below those three sections and the setting and any other pertinent technical information will be at the very top.

These adventure ideas are meant to serve in whatever capacity you deem fit, from complete packages intended to be played out in a single session to the starting points for epic campaign adventures that you and your group can run with for as long as you continue to enjoy them.

Please feel free to print and redistribute any of the information presented, but do please maintain any logos or copyright information that may be attached.

The door locks for the room require the use of either a pick locks skill roll of 30 or an electrical engineering roll of 20 to open the lock and a hacking roll of 25 to open it.The room itself is guarded inside by 2 AO soldiers with assault rifles and heavy military armor.</td>

It seems his home was recently attacked by a pack of Scalerithica during their evening meal. The creatures battered down the door and poured through the windows, attacking everyone in sight. The child's mother tossed him out one of the broken windows and told him to run so, without anywhere else to go, he headed for Rathalon hoping to find someone to help.</td>

The child's family managed to fight their way to the cellar entrance in their home and have been trapped there, beneath the house for days. They require some minor healing but are otherwise doing well and will offer to pay the characters their life's savings of 2D6x100 gold coins for their assistance and the rescue of their child.</td>

<b>Non Player Characters (NPCs) for the future setting</b>

&nbsp;

<b>Conglomerate Citizen</b>

The average person on the street in Conglomerate territories. This person has a basic understanding of the world, their government, and generally considers anyone labeled as a Dissident to be a &lsquo;badguy&rsquo;. If they encounter a Dissident they will almost certainly alert the authorities, although most of them will not put themselves in harm&rsquo;s way to stop a Dissident from doing whatever it is they are doing. Better to let Conglomerate officials deal with that sort of thing and stay out of the way.

<b>Security Guard</b>

The average security guard is little more than a citizen with some extra training in the ways of basic hand to hand combat, weapon usage, and security procedures. These individuals can be found in most places of business at night, and occasionally during the day. Usually these are the first responders to trouble and while it is their job to deal with potential issues, most of them will do only what is necessary to get clear of the issue before reinforcements can arrive.

<b>Conglomerate Soldier</b>

This is your average Conglomerate grunt in the field. These soldiers have seen a few combat engagements but are by no means seasoned veterans. Conglomerate soldiers are generally true believers in what the Conglomerate stands for and will do everything they can to protect citizens, ensure that Dissidents are dealt with swiftly.

<b>Dissident Guerrilla</b>

These are the militants that have chosen to take up arms against the Conglomerate and engage their soldiers in open combat. Guerrillas are experienced warriors, often with years of combat under their belts and hardened bodies, accustomed to the rigors of a war on the fringes of society. These warriors have taken up the cause of liberating humanity from the oppressive regime of the Conglomerate.

&nbsp;

<b>Criminal Element</b>

Unlike Guerrillas, who see themselves as freedom fighters, Criminals are only out to help themselves. These characters range from thugs on the street to organized crime families but in the end they are all more or less the same. Selfish brutes who are willing to hurt anyone to get what they want.

&nbsp;

<b>Dissident Citizen</b>

While the Conglomerate would have everyone believe that the Dissidents are a bunch of criminals that should be shot on sight, the truth is that most of them are just regular people that for one reason or another do not live in Conglomerate facilities. The average Dissident is only different from a Conglomerate citizen in that they are much more accustomed to getting things done and taking care of themselves. Most Dissident Citizens are familiar with basic weapons and how to operate them, but it is still rare that they are required to take up arms against anyone.

&nbsp;

<b>Technician</b>

Whether a Conglomerate Citizen or a Dissident Citizen, a technician is always in demand. These individuals are able to work on just about anything from a computer to an ion drive and make it go. They are passable hackers, adept mechanics and electricians and able to repair or cobble together almost any kind of machine or computer.

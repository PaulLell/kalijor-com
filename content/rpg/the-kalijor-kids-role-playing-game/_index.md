<h3>Product Description</h3>
The Kalijor: Kids Role Playing Game is built on an entirely new game engine and is designed to help you and your players experience the world in your own ideal way. The kids version of the game is aimed at ages 7-14 and is designed to minimize most of the logistical aspects of the game. Players merely pick a class and start playing, much like a video game. Character advancement is handled mostly by the acquisition of funds and equipment, instead of the tracking of accumulated experience and tracking of levels.

If you are interested in a role playing game that your kids can play with you, or on their own, with a minimum of down time, then this is the game for you. But it doesn't stop there.

The best thing about this game is that it is built on the same core game engine as the 'full' Kalijor RPG, which means that characters from this game can jump in and play in any Kalijor or Kalijor: Kids campaign as they are! Or, if your kids grow up with this game but want to move into the 'full' game when they get old enough, then their characters can also be 'upgraded' to the 'full' version of the game to take advantage of the additional features and benefits of the complete rule set.

Kalijor and Kalijor: Kids RPGs. Truly a game for the entire family, and serving gamers of all ages!
